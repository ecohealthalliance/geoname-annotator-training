Coping With Funds Shortage is Topic for Legal Aid Meeting
Daniel C. Vock
July 25, 2002
<geo  id='4250542'>SPRINGFIELD</geo> -- About 225 attorneys and paralegals from across
<geo  id='4896861'>Illinois</geo> who provide legal services to the poor will gather in
<geo  id='4887398'>Chicago</geo> early next week for the first time in 13 years to swap
ideas and offer each other encouragement.
But they&#x27;re also in for some bad news.
John N. Erlenborn, president of the Legal Services Corp., the
entity that doles out federal money for legal aid, will announce at
the conference that <geo  id='4896861'>Illinois</geo> will suffer &quot;seven-figure funding
cuts&quot; next year because of newly released census figures.
Under federal law, money for legal aid is distributed to the
states based on the number of indigent residents.
Erlenborn, a former member of the <ignore  id='undefined'>U.S.</ignore> House of Representatives
from the <geo  id='4887398'>Chicago</geo> area, did not disclose how big the state&#x27;s hit
would be but issued a statement Thursday pointing out that only
four states would lose more federal money than <geo  id='4896861'>Illinois</geo> in
2003.
Last year, the LSC gave <geo  id='4896861'>Illinois</geo> nearly $12 million -- or a
third of the money going to the state&#x27;s legal aid programs -- to
fund the Legal Assistance Foundation of Metropolitan <geo  id='4887398'>Chicago,
Prairie State</geo> Legal Services and Land of Lincoln Legal Assistance
Foundation. Legal aid providers in the state are already scrounging
for funding as interest rates fall through the floor, because one
of their primary sources of support comes from the interest
generated on client assets held in trust by lawyers in
<geo  id='4896861'>Illinois</geo>.
<geo  id='4896861'>Illinois</geo> Supreme Court Justice Thomas L. Kilbride will deliver
the keynote speech to the legal aid providers on Monday and will
discuss the high court&#x27;s plan to hike attorney registration fees by
$42 to cover the shortfall in the interest income.
The high court floated a plan during the spring legislative
session to raise those fees, which would bring in roughly $2.4
million and raise the base fee for active attorneys from $180 to
$222.
That proposal languished, but many observers noted that the high
court could raise the fees without legislative approval.
Organizers of the conference acknowledged that much of the
discussion at the event will center on how to use resources most
effectively on a shoestring budget.
In fact, all of the hotel rooms and conference facilities were
donated to the group after another organization announced at the
end of June that it was calling off its convention, leaving the
facilities open, said Linda Zazove, deputy director of Land of
Lincoln and a member of the conference&#x27;s planning committee.
A core group of legal aid attorneys hatched the idea of a
conference after visiting with representatives of similar programs
in other states who regularly hold such meetings, she said.
Originally, the organizers hoped for a fall convention but they
sprang at the opportunity when the rooms opened up.
&quot;This is a unique opportunity for people who are in the trenches
delivering services to get together, meet each other and share
ideas,&quot; Zazove said.
The providers will attend sessions on car-related consumer law,
bankruptcy, immigration, welfare, assisting pro se clients,
recruiting private attorneys and Internet resources for both
advocates and clients.
Ruth Ann Schmitt, executive director of the Lawyers Trust Fund,
which is covering some of the costs of the gathering, acknowledged
that the legal aid community faces many problems but said the
meeting could give attorneys a morale boost.
&quot;It&#x27;s not often that the rank and file get together to talk
about their problems.... It&#x27;s usually the leadership,&quot; she
said.
This year&#x27;s gathering is limited to lawyers and paralegals
working for legal aid organizations. According to the Lawyers Trust
Fund, which distributes the interest income, there are about 250
<geo  id='4896861'>Illinois</geo> lawyers working full time in the state&#x27;s 20 programs
receiving LTF funds. Another 100 attorneys work part time for those
programs.
The organizers hope to expand the event in the future to include
judges and private attorneys and cover more topics in an Access to
Justice Conference, Zazove said.
