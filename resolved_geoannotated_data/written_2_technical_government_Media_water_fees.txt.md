<geo  id='5323376'>Alpaugh</geo> water fees may triple

It&#x27;s either a big increase or a loss of service for the <geo  id='5403789'>Tulare</geo>
County town.
By Joan Obra
<geo  id='5323376'>Alpaugh</geo> residents may see their water fees triple to avoid
losing service at the end of the month.
The debate will unfold tonight at a <geo  id='5403789'>Tulare County</geo> Water Works
District 1 meeting. The district, which provides water service to
homes in <geo  id='5323376'>Alpaugh</geo>, faces an unpalatable choice: raise its monthly
$20 household fee or go without the arsenic-tainted and undrinkable
water.
<geo  id='5403789'>Tulare County</geo> Water Works&#x27; contract with its only supplier,
Alpaugh Irrigation District, which supplies water to farmers in the
area, ends July 1. And <ignore  id='undefined'>Alpaugh Irrigation</ignore>, which provides water,
recordkeeping and maintenance services to <geo  id='5403789'>Tulare County</geo> Water
Works, is scaling back its role. The district will sell only water
as of July 1, at a monthly price of $43.50 for a household.
&quot;We can no longer do it for $20,&quot; said <ignore  id='undefined'>Alpaugh</ignore> Irrigation board
president Steve Martin. The district, which didn&#x27;t increase prices
fast enough to meet the rising cost of delivering water, amassed an
estimated $330,000 power bill during the state energy crisis. Last
month, <ignore  id='undefined'>Alpaugh</ignore> Irrigation customers approved a monthly fee increase
from $20 to $68.
If <geo  id='5403789'>Tulare County</geo> Water Works wants to keep its 170 hookups
flowing, Martin said, it must also raise rates.
<geo  id='5403789'>Tulare County</geo> Water Works can&#x27;t raise prices until a July 17
election. The propertyrelated fee increase requires voter approval
under Proposition 218, a process <geo  id='5403789'>Tulare County</geo> Water Works
officials started after they learned the outcome of <ignore  id='undefined'>Alpaugh</ignore>
Irrigation&#x27;s vote.
At tonight&#x27;s <geo  id='5403789'>Tulare County</geo> Water Works&#x27; informational meeting,
leaders will explain the rules. To block the possible fee increase,
51% of property owners in the district must submit protest votes in
writing. No protest vote means approval of the price jump.
But misinformation already is rampant. Sandra Meraz, <geo  id='5403789'>Tulare</geo>
County Water Works board president, interrupted an interview
Tuesday when a screaming and crying farmworker arrived.
The farmworker thought the water was getting turned off today,
Meraz explained later.
Part of the confusion stems from Prop. 218. A section of it
calls eligible voters &quot;owners of record.&quot; Another calls them
&quot;tenants ... directly liable to pay the assessment, fee, or charge
in question.&quot;
Alpaugh Irrigation&#x27;s board limited the voter pool to property
owners, sending each English-only notices.
There weren&#x27;t enough Spanish-speaking voters to warrant
bilingual notices, Martin explained in May.
But that move left Spanish speakers and renters angry. As a
result, Chris Schneider, executive director of Central <ignore  id='undefined'>California</ignore>
Legal Services, is building a lawsuit against Alpaugh
Irrigation.
The district &quot;should have sent notices to renters in addition to
property owners,&quot; he said.
<geo  id='5403789'>Tulare County</geo> Water Works may also come under Schneider&#x27;s
fire.
The district sent notices only to property owners because &quot;it&#x27;s
a property-related fee,&quot; attorney Patrick Enright said. He&#x27;s not
yet sure whether <geo  id='5403789'>Tulare County</geo> Water Works will accept renters&#x27;
protest votes at the July 17 meeting
