Law Schools Urge Graduates to Start Small and Think Local
By Greg Winter

Monday, December 16, 2002
Life for the partners of Cates, Katalinic &amp; Lund holds
little of the glamour one might expect from a career in law.
Instead of lunches at <geo  id='2988507'>Lut√®ce</geo>, they caucus at the Palace Diner in
<geo  id='5133268'>Queens</geo>. Wooing clients means passing out fliers on street corners,
not securing box seats at <geo  id='5125640'>Madison Square Garden</geo>. To make ends meet,
one partner stacks pipe and cleans the yard at a plumbing
warehouse. Another handles urine samples in a hospital lab. A sign
of failure, of a feeble economy, perhaps? Hardly. They are heeding
the call of a growing pool of law schools, which are for the first
time pointing graduates in a new direction and teaching them how to
get there. Forget the lure of large firms, the security of a
government post. Here is how to grapple &quot;in the service of
justice,&quot; as many of the schools put it, instead.
Convinced that corporate largess and government programs barely
dent the nation&#x27;s legal needs, the law schools are urging graduates
to buck tradition, pass up big salaries and ignore mushrooming
student debt to join tiny neighborhood practices or simply start
their own, all with an eye toward charging no more than their
clients can afford.
This is not pro bono legal work; it is &quot;low bono,&quot; a term the
schools coined to define the atypical kind of law career they are
training students for. While its practitioners do charge for their
services, they are also dead set on turning no one away - or at
least as few as possible.
&quot;When you go into this kind of social justice law, it&#x27;s really
brutal and you&#x27;re almost guaranteed to struggle for a couple of
years before there&#x27;s a light at the end of the tunnel,&quot; said Fred
Rooney, director of the Community Legal Resource Network at City
University of New York School of Law, from which the lawyers of the
newly formed Cates, Katalinic &amp; Lund graduated last May. &quot;But
if our graduates don&#x27;t do it, the millions of people who cannot
access justice in this country will continue to soar.&quot;
The movement, primly called the consortium, started four years
ago by <ignore  id='undefined'>CUNY</ignore>, <geo  id='4945866'>Northeastern University</geo>, the <geo  id='4372135'>University of Maryland</geo>
and <ignore  id='undefined'>St. Mary&#x27;s Law School</ignore> in <geo  id='4736286'>Texas</geo>. (<ignore  id='undefined'>St. Mary&#x27;s</ignore> later dropped out.)
Since then, it has drawn seven additional law schools to its ranks:
the <geo  id='5012995'>University of Michigan</geo>, <ignore  id='undefined'>Rutgers and </ignore><ignore  id='undefined'><geo  id='5140405'>Syracuse</geo></ignore><ignore  id='undefined'> </ignore>Law Schools, <ignore  id='undefined'>New
York Law School</ignore>, <geo  id='5495948'>University of New Mexico</geo> School of Law, <ignore  id='undefined'>Thomas M.
Cooley Law School and Touro Law School</ignore>. It has elicited at least
initial interest from 19 more. Mixing foundation money with their
own to go beyond the standard curriculum, the schools are teaching
the nuts and bolts of running a business, setting up client
referral networks for fledgling practitioners and holding seminars
to tackle the mundane cha llenges of going it alone that are often
considered superfluous to the study of law.
As further encouragement for the 200 or so followers they have
picked up already, the consortium schools have given their
graduates Palm organizers, paid for companies to help with their
billing, and offered free legal research and even yoga and
meditation classes, almost anything to help make life a little
easier for those trying to hang out their shingles.
&quot;We&#x27;re talking about training real community lawyers,&quot; said Stua
rt L. Deutsch, dean of the <ignore  id='undefined'>Rutgers School of Law</ignore> in <geo  id='5101798'>Newark</geo>. &quot;The
perception is that the solo practitioners are the ones who got C&#x27;s,
the second string who didn&#x27;t excel enough to get to the big firms.
We&#x27;re trying to say that solo practice can be among the highest
forms of public service, and is the only channel possible to
serving low-income people.&quot;
True or not, there is little debate that most low-income
clients, and many in the middle class, find lawyers well outside
their financial reach. Even at the smallest of firms, the median
hourly rate starts at roughly $130 an hour and passes $180,
according to a 2002 survey by Altman Weil, a legal consulting
company. For firms with more than 150 lawyers in tow, the range is
from $200 to more than $320 an hour, the survey found, not counting
the dinners, taxi rides and other extras that are often tacked onto
the bill.
At those rates, perhaps it should come as no surprise that 71
percent of low-income people and 61 percent of moderate-income
people with civil troub les end up without representation,
according to the American Bar Association. For the truly poor,
meaning they earn no more than $11,075 a year, there are
government-financed legal aid agencies to turn to, 172 in all, but
these offices are so overwhelmed that only one in five people who
qualify for help actually gets any.
By contrast, big law firms are slowly stepping up their
commitment to free services, after 10 years of pulling back. Yet
their lawyers still spend less than 42 hours a year doing pro bono
work, far short of the profession&#x27;s guidelines to perform at least
50 volunteer hours each year. Even during more charitable times,
the bar association says, most of the free or less costly work is
handled by small firms and solo practitioners, making the m a
natural target for the consortium&#x27;s sights.
&quot;A lot of students still go to law school because of their
ideals, and they&#x27;re willing to bite the bullet, drive old cars, not
buy a home and keep living a student&#x27;s life for a few more years
until they get settled,&quot; said Lovely Dhillon, the former <geo  id='5391959'>San
Francisco</geo> assistant district attorney who heads the consortium.
&quot;It&#x27;s incumbent on us to help them.&quot;
The consortium certainly has a lot to overcome, most notably the
pull of big law firms. Twenty years ago, three times as many law
school graduates went into solo or tiny practices as went to firms
with more than 100 lawyers, according to the National Association
for Law Placement. By last year, the two poles had flip-flopped,
with the biggest firms attracting 30 percent more graduates than
the smallest, and given the difference in pay it is not hard to see
why.
Joining a firm with fewer than 10 lawyers means starting at
$43,000 a year, the association says. The bigger a practice gets,
though, the higher its starting salaries climb, topping out around
$125,000 a year at the largest firms. Considering that law school
tuitions have roughly doubled in the last decade, pushing the
median student debt past $84,000, it is understandable why some
question how far the consortium can spread.
&quot;It&#x27;s a great idea, but the pressure of academic debt really
leads people to big firms in big cities,&quot; said Theresa J. Bryant,
executive director of the career development office at <ignore  id='undefined'>Yale Law
School,</ignore> which is not part of the consortium. &quot;When you&#x27;re standing
$90,000 in debt, going small may present a bit of a challenge.&quot;
Fair enough, the consortium says. Not all graduates will be able
to scrounge for the years it may take to build a clientele, nor
should they. But since as many as 30 percent to 40 percent of the
graduates at schools like <ignore  id='undefined'>CUNY</ignore> go into small or solo practices
within a few years of graduating, the deans argue, it seems folly
not to teach them how to stay afloat financially and take on
low-income clients at the same time.
How do you advertise? How do you bill clients and, perhaps even
trickier, get them to pay? How can you remain affordable and still
pay your rent? What kind of office software will you need? How
about malpractice insurance? Such are the sobering questions,
rarely highbrow enough to find their way into legal pedagogy, that
the consortium seeks to help their graduates tackle.
&quot;Important as they are, these issues are low on the academic
pecking order, and not what get most faculty recognized,&quot; said
Deborah L. Rhode, former president of the Association of American
Law Schools and a professor of law at <geo  id='5398590'>Stanford University</geo>, also
outside the consortium. &quot;The truth is, legal education is partially
responsible for the disconnect between what ordinary Americans need
and what educated lawyers can supply.&quot;
Even for the most intrepid and socially conscious of graduates,
starting a practice requires a giant leap of faith, and more than a
little guesswork. Charging sliding-scale fees means coming up with
a new wage for almost every case one takes, and seldom can
practitioners rely on anything more solid than their own
judgment.
&quot;How much will we charge?&quot; Tristan Da Cunha, one of the new
graduates starting Cates, Katalinic &amp; Lund asked with a shrug,
furrowing his brow as if the question had never come up. &quot;I think
it&#x27;s fair to say we&#x27;ll be heavily discounted.
