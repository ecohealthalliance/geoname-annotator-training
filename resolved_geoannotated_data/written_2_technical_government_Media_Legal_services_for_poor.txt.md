Legal services for poor facing statewide cuts
Saturday, October 5, 2002
<geo  id='4299276'>LOUISVILLE, Ky</geo>. (AP) - The loss of $1.36 million could mean the
state&#x27;s legal services for the poor will lose six of their 21
regional offices, the head of a poverty-law resource center
said.
It could also mean the loss of some of the 72 lawyers in
<geo  id='6254925'>Kentucky</geo> for the program commonly called &quot;Legal Aid,&quot; as well as
legal assistants and other staff.
&quot;This is a major funding crisis for legal aid throughout the
state,&quot; said Jamie Hamon, executive director of the Access to
Justice Foundation, a statewide poverty-law resource center in
<geo  id='4297983'>Lexington</geo>.
Legal Aid provides noncriminal legal assistance to the poor in
areas such as family law, consumer fraud, housing evictions and
foreclosures.
Statewide, Legal Aid will lose about $800,000 in federal funds -
a cut of about 13 percent from the $6 million it got this year from
the federal Legal Services Corp., which provides most of the money
for Legal Aid.
The state also is facing the loss of about $460,000 - nearly all
the grant money it gets through the federal Violence Against Women
Act - for legal services for poor women who suffer domestic
violence. In addition, because of lower interest rates, it is
facing a decline of about $100,000 in funds from interest collected
on lawyers&#x27; trust accounts.
Hamon said directors of <geo  id='6254925'>Kentucky</geo>&#x27;s four Legal Aid programs still
are reviewing the cuts.
Scott Crocker, executive director of <ignore  id='undefined'>Kentucky</ignore> Legal Aid, which
serves western and southern <geo  id='6254925'>Kentucky</geo>, said his office will lose
about $260,000 out of a budget of about $2.2 million. All of the
agency&#x27;s clients are poor, and many are elderly or disabled, he
said.
The <geo  id='4299276'>Louisville</geo> region is facing the potential loss of three or
four staff members because of the cuts, said Dennis Bricking,
executive director of the <ignore  id='undefined'>Louisville</ignore> Legal Aid Society, which
serves <geo  id='4296218'>Jefferson</geo> and 14 surrounding counties. The cuts will come at
a time when the demand for services is increasing.
Bricking said he expects to lose about $170,000 out of an annual
budget of about $3 million.
Hamon said Legal Aid offices are forced to prioritize cases. For
example, they are more likely to take on eviction cases or
domestic-violence cases if there are children involved and
foreclosure cases when an elderly person has been the victim of
fraud and risks losing a home.
Unless Congress increases funding, <geo  id='6254925'>Kentucky</geo> will lose about
$800,000 in 2003 from the federal program that supports Legal Aid
because funds are tied to each state&#x27;s poverty rate. <geo  id='6254925'>Kentucky</geo>&#x27;s
poverty rate declined about 3 percent under the latest Census
data.
States like <geo  id='6254925'>Kentucky</geo> where poverty declined slightly suffered
cuts because other large states had significant increases in
poverty and will drain additional federal money from the Legal
Services fund, Hamon said.
An amendment to a Senate appropriations bill offered by Sen. Tom
Harkin, D-<ignore  id='undefined'>Iowa</ignore>, that would increase federal Legal Aid funding is
pending, but its passage is uncertain, Bricking said.
Legal Aid officials are particularly worried about impoverished
areas of the state, such as eastern <ignore  id='undefined'>Kentucky</ignore>, served by the
Appalachian Research and Defense Fund, or APPALRED.
&quot;What you&#x27;ve got is poor people with acute legal needs not being
able to have those needs met,&quot; said Ernie Lewis, head of the state
public-defender system and a board member of APPALRED. &quot;I think
each board and each executive director are going to have to reduce
services for poor people.&quot;
He said he expects APPALRED to see a $600,000 cut in its $4
million budget. Legal Aid of the Bluegrass, which serves the
<geo  id='4297983'>Lexington</geo> area and northern <geo  id='6254925'>Kentucky</geo>, could not be reached for an
estimate on its cuts.
Next year, <geo  id='6254925'>Kentucky</geo> will lose almost $500,000 in grants through
the federal Violence Against Women Act used to provide legal
assistance to poor women who are victims of domestic violence. The
<ignore  id='undefined'>U.S.</ignore> Justice Department declined to renew those grants under new
policies that direct the money to start-up programs instead of
funding existing programs, Hamon said.
