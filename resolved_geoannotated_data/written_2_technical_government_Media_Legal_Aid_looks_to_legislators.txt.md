Legal Aid looks to legislators for help

By Robyn L. Minor
Sunday, January 26, 2003
Still stinging from federal grant cuts, <ignore  id='undefined'>Kentucky</ignore> Legal Aid&#x27;s
director is hoping the General Assembly will help heal the
wounds.
&quot;We found a sponsor for legislation,&quot; Director Scott Crocker
said. &quot;Rep. Charles Geveden has introduced legislation that will
increase the Access to Justice supplement on court filing
fees.&quot;
The legislation would increase that supplement on filing civil
cases from $5 to $10 in district courts and from $10 to $20 in
circuit courts. Basic filing fees would then be $55.50 in district
court and $118 in circuit.
The Access to Justice fees are sent to a foundation that
provides money to legal aid services such as <geo  id='4285268'>Bowling Green</geo>&#x27;s
<ignore  id='undefined'>Kentucky</ignore> Legal Aid. That office provides legal aid in non-criminal
cases to low-income, elderly or disabled residents in 35
counties.
The <ignore  id='undefined'>Kentucky</ignore> Bar Association is supporting the legislation.
&quot;They felt the additional filing fee would not prevent people
from being able to file lawsuits,&quot; Crocker said.
In fact, the additional fees will ensure wider access to the
judicial system for <geo  id='6254925'>Kentucky</geo>&#x27;s poor, said Geveden, D-Wickliffe.
&quot;I was pleased to (sponsor the legislation) because it will
provide access to legal services to the poor and underprivileged in
<geo  id='6254925'>Kentucky</geo> that otherwise would have been denied them because of
federal budget cuts and because of some reduction in funds because
of state budget,&quot; Geveden said.
Statewide, legal aid budgets were cut $1.58 million. The
proposed legislation is expected to generate about $1.5
million.
Because of about $300,000 in cuts, <ignore  id='undefined'>Kentucky</ignore> Legal Aid in <geo  id='4285268'>Bowling
Green</geo> is in the process of closing its <geo  id='4295251'>Hopkinsville</geo> office and
already has closed and consolidated others.
A total of six full-time positions and one part-time position,
including attorneys and secretarial or clerical positions, were
eliminated.
If legislation passes and more funding comes in, cuts in
services would be re-evaluated.
The Access to Justice money is distributed to legal aid agencies
based on a poverty population formula. About 21 percent of the fees
would come to this <ignore  id='undefined'>Kentucky</ignore> Legal Aid office, Crocker said.
&quot;We have bipartisan support on this issue and it isn&#x27;t a tax
increase,&quot; he said. &quot;... There is no one actively lobbying against
it, so we hope it would pass.&quot;
Geveden agrees that the bill&#x27;s chances for passage &quot;are pretty
reasonable.&quot;
And while he is pleased to have the endorsement of the bar
association and others, Geveden said, &quot;The best endorsements come
from people at home.
&quot;And I think ... they are doing a good job having people
contacting legislators to encourage their support.&quot;
