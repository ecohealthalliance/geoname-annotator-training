Legal Aid campaign fourth of the way to fund-raising goal

Paul J. Nyden
Thursday, December 12, 2002
Legal Aid of <ignore  id='undefined'>West Virginia</ignore> announced Wednesday that it has
already raised $300,000 toward a three-year goal of $1.2 million to
help its work defending the rights of poor people.
Adrienne Worthy, executive director of Legal Aid, said her
agency will receive $400,000 less in federal funds in 2003, because
the 2000 Census found 30,000 fewer poor people in <geo  id='4826850'>West
Virginia</geo>.
&quot;We cannot meet our needs with previous federal funding levels,
especially since the economy has worsened since the census was
completed,&quot; she said.
Today, <geo  id='4826850'>West Virginia</geo> has more than 315,000 poor people, or 18
percent of the state&#x27;s entire population.
Nearly one of every four children lives in a household whose
income falls below federal poverty levels. More than 31,000 elderly
West Virginians also live in poverty.
A pamphlet being distributed by the new Campaign for Legal Aid
points out, &quot;There is only one Le gal Aid lawyer for every 7,900
poor persons in <geo  id='4826850'>West Virginia</geo>. This compares to about one attorney
for every 368 persons in the general population.&quot;
The two co-chairmen of the campaign are lawyers Al Emch of
Jackson Kelly and Scott Segal of the Segal Law Firm.
Emch said on Wednesday, &quot;I have a lot of confidence in lawyers
in <geo  id='4826850'>West Virginia</geo>, who are professionally responsible and understand
the importance of this project. Everyone has a stake in making our
justice system accessible and fair.&quot;
Segal said raising money to help Legal Aid is critical &quot;to help
battered women, people transferring from welfare to jobs in the
economy, and the elderly. It is important to guarantee everyone
access to justice in the state.&quot;
Last year, Legal Aid helped more than 9,500 poor people in <geo  id='4826850'>West
Virginia</geo>. Individuals helped by Legal Aid include: a young mother
and her children being abused by a violent spouse, a severely
disabled child in need of medical care, a young woman who needed
more time in vocational training to escape welfare, and a woman
suffering from dementia in a nursing home whose husband was trying
to strip her of her financial assets.
Last year, Legal Aid spent $387 for work on its average case.
The cost to provide each hour of legal services was $23.
Legal Aid also works closely with local community organizations,
state and local Bar associations, social workers and local
government agencies.
