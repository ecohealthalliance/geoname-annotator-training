Legal hotline for seniors loses grant, won&#x27;t expand

By Nancy Weaver Teichert
Saturday, January 25, 2003
The loss of a federal grant has stymied plans for the Senior
Legal Hotline to expand its free legal services statewide.
The hotline lost out on a grant from the federal Administration
on Aging, which would have provided $175,000 a year for the next
three years.
David Mandel, supervising attorney, protested to federal
officials about the way the hotline&#x27;s grant application had been
evaluated. He said a package of 20 letters of support failed to
reach some of the judges.
The hotline, which is part of Legal Services of Northern
<geo  id='5332921'>California</geo>, was the only <geo  id='5332921'>California</geo> application from 24 submitted
nationwide for $1.5 million in grants. &quot;It was because of a
screw-up in <geo  id='4140963'>Washington</geo> that <geo  id='5332921'>California</geo> is losing having a program
like this,&quot; said Mandel. &quot;Other states got it instead.&quot;
Kay Loughrey, a program information specialist with the aging
administration, said grant applications were ranked a second time
after the judges got a chance to review the letters. &quot;They went
above and beyond what would be customarily done,&quot; she said. &quot;They
still did not rank high enough to be selected.&quot;
Mandel said the loss means the hotline won&#x27;t continue with plans
to expand statewide and won&#x27;t be able to serve as many people in
Northern <geo  id='5332921'>California</geo>.
About two full-time staff positions will be lost along with
other cuts in staff hours. Last year, about 7,200 people were given
quick legal advice over the telephone and by email, but that number
may drop by 1,000 to 2,000 with the staff cuts this year, Mandel
said.
Chisorom Okwuosa, legal services developer for the <geo  id='5332921'>California</geo>
Department of Aging, said state officials supported the hotline&#x27;s
grant application. The service is needed but the state&#x27;s budget
crisis means it is not in a position to step in and help. &quot;There is
a need to expand legal services as a whole,&quot; she said.
The hotline will emphasize help to <geo  id='5389519'>Sacramento County</geo> seniors
with funds provided by the Area 4 Agency on Aging. It offers legal
advice on landlord and tenant disputes, foreclosures, consumer
disputes and planning for long-term care, including Social Security
issues.
The hotline also has special funds to help grandparents who are
caring for their grandchildren in <geo  id='5389519'>Sacramento</geo>, <geo  id='5383537'>Placer</geo>, <geo  id='5411026'>Yuba</geo>, <geo  id='5400390'>Sutter</geo>,
<geo  id='5410882'>Yolo</geo>, <geo  id='5376509'>Nevada</geo> and <geo  id='5395582'>Sierra</geo> counties. Many grandparents need help on
custody issues.
Earlier this year, the Senior Legal Services Task Force
submitted a report to the state Legislature that supported a
statewide senior legal hotline.
Mandel said the hotline is searching for private foundation
funds to finance its expansion and may increase its efficiency with
a new telephone system.
