Lawyer Web Survey

How Can We Keep Lawyers Doing Good? Nationwide Survey to
Determine Public Interest Law Recruitment/Retention Trends
<geo  id='5815135'>WASHINGTON</geo>, Jan. 22 (AScribe Newswire) -- Pity the &quot;poor&quot;
lawyer. That is, the lawyer who serves the poor and
disenfranchised. Although the cause is just, the less than $40K
starting salary reflects no equality in the marketplace and the law
school loan can be larger than a mortgage. Public interest and
government sector employers fear that these barriers will turn too
many young attorneys away from the battleground of equal justice
and their departure will place the American justice system in
crisis.
To determine if and why lawyers will stay with or leave public
interest law, on February 8, 2002 the National Association for
Public Interest Law (NAPIL) and the National Legal Aid and Defender
Association will launch an online survey at http://www.napil.org/
The survey is designed to gauge the level of the judicial and
educational debt crises. Results of the survey, which is expected
to collect responses from more than 1,000 legal services employers,
attorneys general, public defenders and local civil liberties law
organizations, will be released in April at the annual meeting of
the National Association for Law Placement.
NAPIL Associate Sheila Siegel, Esq., the survey project manager,
noted, &quot;After an attorney&#x27;s first year of public interest
employment, we have no idea about who continues in the field, who
leaves and why. Our results will be brand new data that can fuel
solutions to the &#x27;pricing out&#x27; of a lawyer&#x27;s public interest law
options due to low salaries and enormous law school loan
payments.&quot;
The <ignore  id='undefined'>National</ignore> Association for Public Interest Law leads the
country in organizing, training and supporting public
service-minded law students and in creating summer and postgraduate
public interest jobs that bring equal justice to millions of
low-income persons and families.
