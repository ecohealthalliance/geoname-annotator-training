Legal Aid in <geo  id='4151245'>Clay County</geo> Could Get a Boost
R. Michael Anderson
People who are most in need of a lawyer&#x27;s help in <geo  id='4151245'>Clay County</geo>
often are the ones who can least afford it. That&#x27;s when
<ignore  id='undefined'>Jacksonville</ignore> Area Legal Aid Inc. steps in to fill the gap.
But even though Legal Aid lawyers provide legal services to
thousands of indigent clients in Northeast <geo  id='4155751'>Florida</geo>, including
hundreds a year in <geo  id='4151245'>Clay County</geo>, the needs of many others go unmet
due to budgetary constraints and staffing limitations.
With only one lawyer and one paralegal in its <geo  id='4151245'>Clay County</geo> branch
office in <geo  id='4157427'>Green Cove Springs</geo>, the non-profit agency handled more
than 300 cases last year, said Michael Figgins, executive director.
But for every client who received help fighting negligent
landlords, abusive husbands or federal benefit program
administrators, four others did not.
&quot;Study after study shows unmet needs to be about 80 percent,&quot; he
said.
The ability to handle more cases is about to take a big jump,
however, as a result of an increase in revenue from fees charged
for every civil action filed in court in <geo  id='4151245'>Clay County</geo>. The County
Commission has endorsed a request to boost the filing fee from $10
to $25 and could approve an ordinance as early as Tuesday to
implement the fee hike.
&quot;Currently, we spend about $250,000 a year in <geo  id='4151245'>Clay County</geo>, which
is about 8 percent of our budget,&quot; said Figgins, adding that <geo  id='4151245'>Clay
County</geo> clients also represent about 8 percent of the total &quot;poverty
population&quot; served by Legal Aid last year in <geo  id='4153840'>Duval</geo>, <geo  id='4146548'>Baker</geo>, <geo  id='4165603'>Nassau</geo>
and <geo  id='4151245'>Clay</geo> counties.
The additional revenue from higher court-filing fees will total
about $60,000 a year, of which approximately $40,000 will be spent
on salary for an additional lawyer to assist Gloria Einstein, who
has been the only Legal Aid lawyer in <geo  id='4151245'>Clay County</geo> for many
years.
The only way to get a lawyer so cheaply will be to find one with
limited experience, or perhaps one fresh out of law school with a
strong desire to &quot;provide justice to low-income people,&quot; Figgins
said.
Legal Aid handles only civil cases. Child custody and domestic
violence cases, housing discrimination, divorce, consumer fraud and
Social Security and Medicare entitlements make up the majority of
the agency&#x27;s case load.
The last time court filing fees were increased in <geo  id='4151245'>Clay County</geo> to
help fund the program was in 1998, when commissioners approved an
increase from $5 to $10.
Of the more than 300 Legal Aid cases in <geo  id='4151245'>Clay</geo> last year, roughly
40 percent involved women who had been abused by violent husbands
and were seeking divorces, Figgins said. Most of the women were
referred to Legal Aid by Quigley House, <geo  id='4151245'>Clay County</geo>&#x27;s sexual
assault and domestic violence center.
In domestic violence situations involving married clients, the
victims need to legally sever their marital relationship with their
abusive spouses in order to move on with their lives, Figgins said,
and <ignore  id='undefined'>Jacksonville</ignore> Area Legal Aid provides the expertise to
accomplish that.
Sharon Youngerman, executive director of Quigley House, said
about 75 percent of the women who come to her agency in search of
help have children. But most have no financial resources, which is
why so many remain in abusive situations for years.
&quot;Everyone asks why does she stay in the abusive situation,&quot;
Youngerman said. &quot;Well, if she can&#x27;t get a divorce she doesn&#x27;t have
any kind of legal paperwork that would require him to support her
[and their children].&quot;
The services Legal Aid provides, she said, are critical to
helping indigent victims of domestic violence achieve the freedom
they need to start their lives over and begin to recover from years
of physical and psychological trauma.
&quot;Very few of our clients have the financial resources to do this
on their own,&quot; Youngerman said. &quot;Generally, if they had the
resources they don&#x27;t need shelter and they can afford private
counseling.&quot;
