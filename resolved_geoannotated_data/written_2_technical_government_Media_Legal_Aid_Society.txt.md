Legal Aid Society ensures justice for needy
Arthur J. Siegel
The Times Union coverage of Law Day quoted Chief Judge Judith S.
Kaye as saying, &quot;The promise of freedom and equal justice is an
empty one if our justice system is not accessible.&quot; Unfortunately,
there was no mention of the Capital Region&#x27;s own Legal Aid Society
of Northeastern <geo  id='5128638'>New York</geo>, the nonprofit organization that works to
ensure that justice is available to the poor, the disabled and the
endangered members of our community.
LASNNY is one of the oldest and most cost-effective legal
services organizations in the <geo  id='6252001'>United States</geo>. Originally
incorporated in 1923 as the Legal Aid Society of <ignore  id='undefined'>Albany</ignore>, it now
serves income- eligible clients in eight counties throughout the
Capital Region. LASNNY provides only needed civil legal aid --
urgent, noncriminal assistance to low-income people. Last year, the
LASNNY helped more than 14,000 people.
Funding for legal aid preserves community resources and saves
tax dollars. For example, in 2001, LASNNY:
Opened 585 cases for the victims of domestic violence, helping
to break the cycle of violence that causes so much lasting harm to
women and children.
Prevented or forestalled 112 evictions, saving shelter costs of
$151,619 and the disruption that families suffer when they are
displaced.
Won 87 SSI/SSD cases enabling clients to receive $850,016 in
retroactive benefits, saving state taxpayers $441,786 and enabling
people with disabilities to live with dignity.
Because we lack sufficient public and private support, the
dedicated attorneys and staff at LASNNY are limited in their
ability to serve all those in need. As a result, an estimated four
out of five low-income people requiring legal help in our community
do not receive it.
Our elected officials, and all who are concerned about providing
equal access to justice for all, must step forward and support
Legal Aid services. If not, many of our neighbors will continue to
be denied the protection of the laws and freedoms we cherish and
promote throughout the world.
