Newsmaker: Legal-aid chief loves challenges
BY JULIE ANDERSON
<ignore  id='undefined'>WORLD</ignore>-HERALD STAFF WRITER
Taking charge of <geo  id='5073708'>Nebraska</geo>&#x27;s statewide legal-aid law firm fit
Doug German&#x27;s beliefs in treating everyone fairly and holding those
in power accountable.

It also fit with his
history of taking on new challenges.
Over his nearly 60 years, the Eustis, Neb., attorney has served
in the Peace Corps in <geo  id='3686110'>Colombia</geo> and worked as an advance man during
Robert F. Kennedy&#x27;s run for president.
German bought into a coffee farm in <geo  id='3624060'>Costa Rica</geo> and later adopted
three sisters from that country. And during a short career as a
Cornhusker football player, he shooed a young Tom Osborne off a
practice field.
But after about a quarter century in private practice, he
resigned in April 2000 and became executive director of <ignore  id='undefined'>Nebraska</ignore>
Legal Services.
The firm had just been created through the merger of three
groups: the Legal Aid Society of <ignore  id='undefined'>Omaha</ignore>, Legal Services of Southeast
<ignore  id='undefined'>Nebraska</ignore> in <geo  id='5072006'>Lincoln</geo> and Western Legal Services of <ignore  id='undefined'>Grand Island</ignore>.
Since then, he&#x27;s logged 60,000 miles between Eustis and the firm&#x27;s
seven offices across the state and thrown himself into the firm&#x27;s
effort to see that as many low-income Nebraskans as possible get
legal help.
Right now, <ignore  id='undefined'>Nebraska</ignore> Legal Services, which handles about 95
percent of the state&#x27;s legal-aid cases, figures it reaches only 15
percent of the 211,000 Nebraskans eligible by income for its
services. That&#x27;s about 8,500 cases a year.
Most of the cases involve family law - from child abuse and
neglect matters to landlord-tenant disputes. The group does not
handle criminal cases.
Based on an American Bar Association formula, the firm estimates
that <geo  id='5073708'>Nebraska</geo>&#x27;s low-income residents will be involved in about
65,000 significant legal matters this year.
Those who can&#x27;t afford access to the criminal justice system may
lose hope or take matters into their own hands, German said.
&quot;I have a fear that we have a generation of people who are
coming up not believing in the system,&quot; German said. &quot;That&#x27;s going
to spell problems.&quot;
Originally, most legal-aid work was funded by Congress through
the Legal Services Corp. With cuts in federal funding, local firms
have been pressed to raise more money.
Federal funding will make up $1.53 million of the <geo  id='5073708'>Nebraska</geo>
group&#x27;s $3.9 million budget this year. The rest will come from the
<ignore  id='undefined'>Nebraska</ignore> Commission on Public Advocacy, <geo  id='5073708'>Nebraska</geo> lawyers&#x27; trust
accounts, individual donations, grants and contracts.
Eric Kleiman, a spokesman for Legal Services Corp. in
<geo  id='4140963'>Washington, D.C.</geo>, said German has been out front nationally in
raising funds and in using new technology, including a statewide
Web site.
&quot;The best program directors in <geo  id='6252001'>America</geo> are the ones that are
able to adjust to the reality of the time,&quot; Kleiman said.
German came to <ignore  id='undefined'>Nebraska</ignore> Legal Services with a goal of doubling
the firm&#x27;s capacity to serve. That means raising an additional $2.5
million a year.
One step toward that goal was a recent pledge by some of the
state&#x27;s leading lawyers to raise up to $1 million for the firm over
the next three years. Other campaigns are under way.
In addition, <ignore  id='undefined'>Nebraska</ignore> Legal Services is involved in a committee
developing a statewide plan for expanding legal services for
low-income residents.
The legal profession, German said, has an obligation to provide
access to the justice system because it has taken on the role of
gateway to that system.
In a sense, German&#x27;s new job isn&#x27;t far from where he started
decades ago.
After finishing high school in <geo  id='5066355'>Cozad, Neb.</geo>, German went off to
the <geo  id='5080886'>University of Nebraska-Lincoln</geo>. As a sophomore, the 6-foot-1,
160-pound quarterback joined the freshman football team. It was
1961, Bob Devaney&#x27;s first year as coach.
One day, German was out throwing passes at an early practice.
People often dropped by asking to run a few plays. One was a skinny
redhead.
German agreed but told the redhead he&#x27;d better get out of there
when the linemen came out. Two weeks later, Tom Osborne, then a
graduate assistant, was one of his coaches. German&#x27;s football
career was short - he admits he was outclassed - but he still has a
copy of Devaney&#x27;s first playbook.
German graduated with a mechanical engineering degree in 1965,
then joined the Peace Corps, spending two years in <geo  id='3686110'>Colombia</geo>.
Back in <geo  id='5073708'>Nebraska</geo>, he helped organize part of a whistlestop tour
from <geo  id='5821086'>Cheyenne, Wyo.</geo>, across <geo  id='5073708'>Nebraska</geo> for the Robert Kennedy
campaign. A few weeks later, Kennedy was assassinated in
<geo  id='5332921'>California</geo>.
German moved on to simultaneously earn a law degree from UNL and
a master&#x27;s degree in regional planning from the University of
<ignore  id='undefined'>Pennsylvania</ignore>. He worked for a legal-aid firm in <geo  id='5072006'>Lincoln</geo> and briefly
ran a legal clinic with two friends. Then he went into private
practice in <geo  id='5066355'>Cozad</geo>.
In 1979, he stopped at a <geo  id='5071934'>Lexington</geo> clothing store to buy cowboy
boots. A friend persuaded him to see a coffee farm in <geo  id='3624060'>Costa Rica</geo>,
mostly as a fun trip.
German and two partners still own the 60-acre farm. He and his
wife, Connie Koch, own the Jose Bravo Coffee Co., which buys and
markets part of the 40,000 pounds of environmentally friendly
coffee the farm produces each year.
Koch owns the Eustis Pool Hall, a local landmark and restaurant,
and the Hotel Eustis.
German and Koch adopted three sisters from <geo  id='3624060'>Costa Rica</geo> not long
after their marriage in 1985. Years before in <geo  id='3686110'>Colombia</geo>, German had
looked into the eyes of poor children and told himself he&#x27;d help if
he was ever in a position to do so.
The two oldest sisters are married and have their own children.
The youngest attends classes and is a standout point guard at
<geo  id='5695213'>Eustis-Farnam High School</geo>. German knows, because he goes to her
games.
German, who also plays basketball, wants to make sure his new
firm&#x27;s employees have an opportunity for family time while doing
good work.
The staff is driven by reasons other than money, he said, and
the firm employs some of the area&#x27;s best attorneys in their
fields.
&quot;We will be known, if we&#x27;re not already, as an outstanding law
firm.&quot;
