Mobile home residents sue city for loss, moving costs
Wednesday, <ignore  id='undefined'>May 29, 2002</ignore>
By Jan Ackerman, Post-Gazette Staff Writer
Residents and former residents of a <geo  id='5198094'>Lincoln Place</geo> mobile home
park that is being demolished to make way for a city-owned
community center are demanding that the government compensate them
for lost trailers and relocation costs.
On Friday, a group of residents filed a lawsuit against
<geo  id='5206379'>Pittsburgh</geo>, seeking damages for families who were displaced and
sometimes forced to abandon their mobile homes because they
couldn&#x27;t afford to move them.
The lawsuit, filed by attorneys for Neighborhood Legal Services
Association and Community Justice Project, asked the <geo  id='5178040'>Allegheny
County</geo> courts to appoint a board of viewers under the state Eminent
Domain Code to determine &quot;just compensation and relocation
expenses&quot; for five families who still live there and for several
who already were evicted.
The city has offered $700,000 for the 7.2-acre site, which
Edward J. Raimondi Jr. of Munhall bought for $500,000 in July 2000.
The city plans to build a community center for <geo  id='5198094'>Lincoln Place</geo> and a
future fire station on the site.
Raimondi has been evicting residents and demolishing trailers
that are left behind in order to meet a city requirement that he
present a clean piece of land with no environmental concerns.
In the suit, NLS attorney Eileen D. Yacknin and Evalynn B.
Welling, Community Justice Project attorney, contend that the city
is trying to avoid its responsibilities to the tenants under state
eminent domain code and the federal Housing and Community
Development Act by having Raimondi carry out the evictions.
The attorneys contended that the city has an obligation to pay
the tenants for damages they have sustained by being evicted for
property that will be used for a public purpose.
&quot;Many of them were compelled to abandon the mobile homes they
had owned for years, because they lacked the financial resources --
typically $2,500 to $3,000 -- which would have been required to
move their homes from the property,&quot; Yacknin wrote.
Yesterday, Deputy Mayor Sal Sirabella said he had not seen the
lawsuit. He said the city still maintains that the residents of the
mobile home park must seek any compensation from Raimondi, not from
the city.
&quot;Our agreement of sale is with Mr. Raimondi, and the issues
between him and the former tenants are his to resolve,&quot; said
Sirabella.
&quot;I believe we have a sales agreement that has been signed,&quot;
Sirabella said, adding that no closing date has been set.
One of the plaintiffs, Joan Tate, who is disabled, was forced to
move into a federally subsidized rental housing in May because of
&quot;increasingly uninhabitable conditions in the park,&quot; the suit
said.
Tate, who receives less than $600 a month from Supplemental
Social Security, could not afford to pay several thousand dollars
to relocate her mobile home, which was appraised at $2,500. As soon
as she moved out, the mobile home was demolished, the suit
said.
