Where to go
Whether you’re in <geo  id='2512989'>Palma</geo>, a coastal resort, or an inland
village, you can reach any point on <geo  id='6453300'>Mallorca</geo> in half a day, and Menorca
is even smaller and more concentrated. On both islands, tour companies
offer excursions by road or in combinations with boat trips, to see the
mountain and coastal scenery, famed beaches, spectacular caves, and
various purpose-built attractions. At these sights, though, you’ll
invariably be part of a crowd, especially in high season (which grows
every year). Accommodations are also at a premium from July through
September. Charter flights and package deals (hotel and airfare) become
considerably more economical if you’re willing to visit in the shoulder
or off season.
Hiring a car (see page 104) is the ideal way to see <geo  id='6453300'>Mallorca</geo>
and Menorca, allowing you to go where you like — some of the
least-known places are the most delightful. You can get around by
public bus, with a couple of trains thrown in, but those options won’t
allow you to see as much in a short time.
The great majority of visitors enter the Balearics through
its capital, <geo  id='2512989'>Palma de Mallorca</geo> (and in fact, most stay within 20 km (13
miles) or so of the city, ensconced in seaside hotels and villas). Any
thought you might have had that you would be vacationing in a sleepy
Mediterranean island backwater will quickly be dashed upon arrival at
sprawling Son Sant Joan, <geo  id='2512989'>Palma de Mallorca</geo>’s international airport.
As islands go, <geo  id='6453300'>Mallorca</geo> is quite large: it has more than 550
km (325 miles) of coastline and is, at its widest, 100 km (60 miles)
across. Visiting all the major regions of <geo  id='6453300'>Mallorca</geo> with any degree of
seriousness would require several weeks, while most of much-smaller
Menorca can be seen in a week’s time. On a short holiday, it’s best to
choose a couple of regions and take them in at a relaxed pace. See the
list of beach highlights on pages 82 and 85.
<geo  id='2512989'>PALMA DE MALLORCA
Palma</geo> is a large, cosmopolitan, working city, with a
population that accounts for two-thirds of the permanent population of
<geo  id='6453300'>Mallorca</geo>. Yet the city feels undeniably tropical and sensual. This has
something to do with the palm trees, relentless sunshine, yachts
bobbing in the bay, and fishermen laying out their nets on the
waterfront, to be sure, but it’s also a product of the way locals talk,
walk, dress, and sip wine and coffee at outdoor cafés. Their leisurely
manner tells you this is no mainland capital.
<geo  id='2512989'>Palma</geo> dominates the island — a glance at the map shows how
the island’s road system radiates from the city — but it is a world far
removed from the mountain villages of the northwest, the small towns of
the interior, and the tourist-ruled coastal villas. The area of
greatest interest to visitors is the small old quarter that surrounds
the cathedral, which sits on a small hill overlooking the bay. Historic
<geo  id='2512989'>Palma</geo> can be seen in a day or two, though the plazas, cafés,
restaurants, and bars may cause you to linger.
From the harbor the great Gothic cathedral rises on a small
hill and dominates the center of <geo  id='2643741'>the city</geo>, with the ancient Almudaina
Palace immediately below it. To the east is <geo  id='6545002'>Platja de Palma</geo>, a long
line of excellent sandy beaches that have been defaced by a sad stretch
of concrete from Ca’n Pastilla to S’Arenal; to the west is the elegant
seaside promenade, Passeig Marítim, of modern <geo  id='2512989'>Palma</geo>, where luxury
hotels look out over a forest of masts in the yacht harbor. Crowning
the wooded slopes above it are the stone towers of Bellver Castle.
The Romans established a strategic post near where Palma
now stands so gracefully, but the Moors were primarily responsible for
transforming the site into a real city. Few Arab buildings remain,
having been razed during the Reconquest, but the old quarter (Centre
Historic on direction signs) still abounds with buildings of historic
interest, preserved when <geo  id='2512989'>Palma</geo> fell into decline in the 16th and 17th
centuries. The old city’s narrow, atmospheric streets are full of
pleasant surprises, best seen on foot.
The focus of any visit to <geo  id='2512989'>Palma</geo> is, justifiably, its
massive Gothic Cathedral — one of the finest churches in <geo  id='2510769'>Spain</geo>. Called
<geo  id='6358933'>La Seu</geo> by locals, it was begun in 1230, after the Christians recaptured
the island from the Moors. King Jaume made an emphatic political point
by ordering it built on the site of the Great Mosque. Building was slow
and sporadic, affected by wars and finance, and the great work took
nearly four centuries to complete. Densely packed buttresses facing
seaward create an extraordinary effect of power and beauty, especially
when they blaze like gold in the setting sun and cast their reflection
in the pool below. Before entering, have a look at the remarkable
Portal del <geo  id='2513835'>Mirador</geo> entrance, overlooking <geo  id='2512989'>Palma</geo>’s bay. The 14th-century
door is a feast of carved stone figurines, including a depiction of the
Last Supper by Guillem Sagrera. The north door of the cathedral, near
the 13th-century bell tower, is reserved for those attending religious
services in the early morning and early evening. Tourists are
encouraged to visit the cathedral in conjunction with the Cathedral
Museum next door, a treasure-trove of silver monstrances and
candelabra, saintly relics, Gothic paintings, and Baroque altars. A
colossal and ornate early Renaissance doorway in carved stone leads on
to the oval New Chapter House. From the museum, one enters the
cathedral.
The wrought-iron Crown of Thorns canopy over the high altar
(called the Baldachino) was added by the Catalan modernista architect
Antoni Gaudí at the beginning of the 20th century. Gaudí, who worked
some 10 years on the cathedral, also moved the choir stalls from the
central nave.
On the west side of the cathedral is the Palau de
l’Almudaina, once the royal residence of the Moorish rulers. Part of
the palace is open to visitors, and a short tour takes in a
stone-vaulted 13th-century throne room, divided into two stories in the
16th century — you’ll see that the window was cut off in the process.
In the heavily restored royal offices, which are used by the present
king and queen, traces of early paintwork survive on ceilings and
frescoed walls. There are also several impressive 15th- and
16th-century Flemish tapestries.
Leafy Passeig des Born, the elongated plaza that runs
inland, is where locals love to take their early evening promenade.
Once the site of jousting tournaments, it’s now lined with park benches
and cafés. At no. 27 is an 18th-century Italianate mansion, Casa
Solleric, which today houses a cultural foundation and hosts art
exhibitions.
In the narrow streets behind the cathedral are tall houses,
several of which are baronial mansions dating from the 15th and 16th
centuries, with dark walls and great wooden doors. Their forbidding
exteriors hide some of <geo  id='2512989'>Palma</geo>’s most inviting courtyards, which can be
glimpsed through the heavy metal grilles. The Can Bordils on carrer
Almudaina retains its Gothic architecture; Can Oms, at number 7, is an
18th-century noble house with one of <geo  id='2512989'>Palma</geo>’s finest patios. Crossing
over carrer Almudaina is the ancient Arab arch, Arc de L’Almudaina.
Many courtyards were remodeled in the 17th and 18th centuries,
including Casa Olesa (carrer Morey, 9), with its cool, wide-arched
patios, balconies and stately staircases. Other spectacular mansions
are nearby on carrer Can Savellà; look for the the Baroque Can Vivot
(sometimes called Can Sureda) at number 4 and Can Catlar del Llorer,
with its Gothic patio built in the 13th century, at number 15.
On carrer de la Portella, a palatial Renaissance mansion
has been restored as the somewhat sleepy <geo  id='10278621'>Museu de Mallorca</geo>.
Descriptions are only in Catalan, but the relics of the Muslim period
and fine 13th- to 15th-century paintings and carvings, originally from
<geo  id='2512989'>Palma</geo>’s churches, antique tiles and ceramics, and a display of
modernista furniture on the top floor make the museum worth a visit.
The top floor also houses exhibitions by present-day Mallorcan artists.
Old photographs show some of the Arab gateways that were destroyed when
the city walls were razed in 1902. The Banys Àrabs (Arab Baths), behind
the museum on carrer de Can <geo  id='2510940'>Serra</geo>, 7, are miraculously still standing
after 1,000 years.
The 13th-century Basílica de <geo  id='2511387'>Sant Francesc</geo> (Basílica of St.
Francis), on the Plaça <geo  id='2511387'>Sant Francesc</geo>, is one of <geo  id='2512989'>Palma</geo>’s treasures. A
statue of Junípero Serra, the 18th-century founder of the first
Franciscan missions in <geo  id='5332921'>California</geo>, is erected in front of the
Plateresque carved portal. Inside the church lies the sarcophagus of
the 13th-century sage and scholar Ramón Llull. He and Serra are two of
<geo  id='6453300'>Mallorca</geo>’s greatest sons and heroes — they have both been beatified,
and sainthood seems sure to follow. The church is rather dark and
heavy, a real contrast with the enchanting cloisters, whose slender
double columns and stone tracery are light and delicate.
The Plaça Cort is the site of the fine wooden-eaved
17th-century Renaissance Ajuntament (Town Hall) and from there it’s a
short way by smart shopping streets to the yellow façades and green
shutters of the <geo  id='10860019'>Plaça Major</geo>, the former marketplace. On the west side
of the <geo  id='10860019'>Plaça Major</geo> is Plaça de Marqués Palmer; sandwiched among chic
leather and footwear shops are two excellent examples of modernista
(Catalan Art Nouveau) architecture: Can Forteza Rei and L’Àguila, whose
iron grill work and broken-tile flourishes are similar to better-known
modernista buildings found in <geo  id='3128760'>Barcelona</geo>.
Down the steps that lead to the <geo  id='10860019'>Plaça Major</geo> is Plaça Weyler
(off of carrer Unió), where there are two more fine examples of
modernisme. One is the imposing and ornate former Gran Hotel. The first
modern hotel in <geo  id='6453300'>Mallorca</geo>, it was built in 1903 by Lluís Doménech i
Muntaner, the architect responsible for <geo  id='3128760'>Barcelona</geo>’s wondrous <geo  id='2988743'>Palau</geo> de
la Música concert hall. Across from the Gran Hotel is a small bakery,
the Forn des Teatre, whose modernista decoration graces many a postcard
in <geo  id='2512989'>Palma</geo>. Down the street, next to Plaça Mercat, is Can Casayas, two
more gently undulating modernista buildings.
Back near the waterfront, the turreted Sa Llotja (<geo  id='9407203'>La Lonja</geo>
in Spanish) was built in the mid-15th century by local architect
Guillem Sagrera (the seafront promenade is named after him). Once the
city merchants’ stock exchange (now used to house art exhibitions — the
only time it can be visited), it is one of <geo  id='2510769'>Spain</geo>’s finest civic Gothic
buildings. Slim columns twist through its light and airy interior to
the vaulted roof. Next to Sa Llotja, a cannon and an anchor surround
the 17th-century Consolat de Mar, the former maritime law court — now
the seat of the <geo  id='6424360'>Balearic Islands</geo>’ autonomous government.
When the evening promenade disperses, the streets of the
old city are usually quiet, dark, and practically deserted, though the
small streets between Plaça de La Llotja and Plaça la Reina teem with
restaurants and bars. There is still more action if you head west to Es
Jonquet, once the fishermen’s quarter, now full of bars, cafés, and
clubs clustering under the old windmills which used to grind the city’s
flour.
A few hundred meters inland from Es Jonquet, the Poble
Espanyol is a rather kitschy walled town of scaled-down replicas of
Spanish architectural treasures from across <geo  id='2510769'>Spain</geo>, including <geo  id='6357709'>Granada</geo>’s
famed <geo  id='2521991'>Alhambra</geo> palace. The buildings house shops, craft studios, bars,
and cafés.
Just south of the <geo  id='6424328'>Poble Espanyol</geo>, perched on a hilltop amid
pine trees and parkland, is the fine <geo  id='2521169'>Castell de Bellver</geo> (Bellver
Castle). A magnificent example of Gothic military architecture, the
castle has commanded the sea and land approaches to the city since its
construction in the early 14th century by order of King Jaume II. The
view from the circular battlements of the city and Bay of <geo  id='2512989'>Palma</geo> is
stunning. Notice how the sloping roof funneled rainwater into the
castle’s cisterns. Inside, there’s a small, well-laid-out museum of the
archaeology of the area.
THE BAY OF <geo  id='2512989'>PALMA</geo>
Two magnificent sweeps of white sand almost 30 km (19
miles) long made <geo  id='2512989'>Palma</geo>’s bay a summertime people-magnet, and the
resorts that mushroomed along them gave <geo  id='6453300'>Mallorca</geo> a name for cheap and
cheerful holidays in the 1960s and ‘70s. In recent years, the picture
has turned decidedly boozy and tacky. Athough the coast around <geo  id='2512989'>Palma</geo> is
dominated by down-market package tourism, there are pockets of
luxurious and expensive tourist villas.
East: <geo  id='6545002'>Platja de Palma</geo>
The southeastern shore of the bay runs through former
fishing villages to the beach resort and yacht harbor of Ca’n Pastilla,
almost at the end of the airport runway. Then come <geo  id='6695627'>Sometimes</geo>, Las
Maravillas, and S’Arenal, on a 7-km (4-mile) strip of hotels, fast food
restaurants, high-throttle bars and discos, British pubs, and German
beerhalls. By day you’ll have to pick your way across the beach through
a sea of tightly packed bodies — despite the inconveniences, Platja de
<geo  id='2512989'>Palma</geo> is an outstanding long (4.5 km/2.8 miles) stretch of white
sand.
West Side of the Bay
To the west of <geo  id='2512989'>Palma</geo>, Cala Major (“great cove”) was a
holiday center long before the package-tour boom. The Catalan
surrealist painter Joan Miró was a longtime resident of this area, and
the Fundació Pilar i Joan Miró displays a fine selection of his work,
as well as his studio as he left it, and his living quarters. The
coast, a mix of rocks and sand, continues west, past exclusive Bendinat
up to Portals Nous, where apartment blocks cluster on the slopes. The
glamorous-looking marina of Puerto Punta Portals is not natural but
ambitiously carved out of the cliffs.
Sandy beaches start again at <geo  id='6544382'>Costa d’En Blanes</geo> and <geo  id='2512989'>Palma</geo>
Nova, which morphs into big, brash, and overwhelmingly British
Magalluf. The wide and sandy beach, sloping safely into the sea, is a
solid block of bronzing bodies in summer. If you’re looking for a bit
of tourism overkill, this is where you’ll find it: bars a block long,
discos built like airport terminals, restaurants offering menus in
eight languages from Finnish to French, waterslides, go-karts — you
name it, Magalluf has it. Everything but sanity.
To the south, the once-quiet cove of Cala Vinjes (kah-la
veen-juhs) has been practically buried in an orgy of concrete. Head for
cover by continuing on through pine woods to narrow winding lanes to
the pretty coves and beaches of Portals Vells (pohr-tahls vays). In the
cliffs, you’ll find huge rock-cut caverns dating from Roman times or
earlier, enlarged over the centuries. Boats make the short excursion
from the pier on Magalluf beach (meaning it’s not always as peaceful as
you might hope). Not far south of Portals Vells, you can hike to a very
quiet cove, Cala Figuera. Farther on the road is blocked: the end of
the peninsula is a military zone.
THE WESTERN TIP
The main road bypasses the resorts of the Bay of <geo  id='2512989'>Palma</geo> and
meets up with the sea once again at <geo  id='6324533'>Santa Ponça</geo>, a modern villa that
boasts one of the widest ranges of sports in <geo  id='6453300'>Mallorca</geo> and keeps going
during the off season with an older clientele.
The pleasantly tree-shaded beaches of Cala Fornells are
still picturesque, although hotels and clusters of Mexican
hacienda-style villas press closely round. A scenic but twisting little
road leads to <geo  id='6476025'>Port</geo> d’<geo  id='2521741'>Andratx</geo>, a broad, wonderfully sheltered bay that
is home to more yachts than fishing boats these days. The old harbor
area on the south side keeps its traditional appearance, though a
closer look reveals a string of chic restaurants, and the slopes facing
it across the water are encrusted with villas and apartments, most of
which have now been bought up by wealthy Germans as second homes
(Claudia Schiffer among them). Lack of a sandy beach has kept the big
hotels away, which is just fine with most visitors. A short drive,
brisk walk, or morning jog takes you 3 km (2 miles) to the Cap de Sa
Mola, the most southwesterly point o n the island, with its superb
views of sheer cliffs and sparkling sea.
From in-land <geo  id='2521741'>Andratx</geo>, a dead-end road leads to the coast at
Sant Elm, a former fishing village that doesn’t try too hard to be a
resort. The view offshore from its mostly stony little beaches is
dominated by the island of Sa Dragonera, said to look like a dragon
rising from the sea, and subject of a long legal battle between
would-be developers and conservationists. The green movement appears to
have protected the odd-shaped island.
NORTHWEST: COAST AND MOUNTAINS
The most dramatic stretch of <geo  id='6453300'>Mallorca</geo>’s coastline looks
across the Mediterranean to <geo  id='3128760'>Barcelona</geo>. The rugged mountains of the
<geo  id='2510940'>Serra</geo> de <geo  id='9171199'>Tramuntana</geo> sweep down to the sea so steeply here that there
are few points of access and only one harbor and <geo  id='6476025'>port</geo> of any size along
the coast. The road winds along clifftops and the sea, providing a
series of vertigo-inducing viewpoints, and meandering back into the
mountains. Interspersed among the cliffs are terraced orchards, olive
groves, and photogenic medieval villages. North of <geo  id='2521741'>Andratx</geo>, the coastal
road C-710 reaches the first of a succession of miradors, lookout
points with a commanding prospect of the entire coast. Some of them are
still crowned with an ancient watchtower, from which lookouts anxiously
scanned the sea for pirate ships and signaled warnings to the next
point along the chain. If possible, make the trip early in the morning,
or you’ll be part of a procession from one parking spot to the next.
The <geo  id='2513835'>Mirador</geo> de Ricardo Roca provides enticing views of the coast
looking north, but save some film, because they’re even better a bit
farther on.
Four km (21/2 miles) from the Roca lookout, <geo  id='2517827'>Estellencs</geo> is a
pretty, ancient town amid terraces and orange groves. From town you can
walk or drive down a track to a little fishing cove. Back on the main
road, some 5 km (3 miles) from <geo  id='2517827'>Estellencs</geo>, take in perhaps the finest
view of the entire coast — quite an accolade — from the snail-shaped
16th-century tower of the <geo  id='2513835'>Mirador</geo> de Ses Ànimes. Green cliffs tumble
into the stunningly blue Mediterranean far as the eye can see on either
side. The next town’s name is clearly Arabic in origin, and in fact the
hillsides around <geo  id='2521361'>Banyalbufar</geo> have been tamed since Moorish times into
some of the finest (and most photographed) terraces on the island.
<geo  id='2521361'>Banyalbufar</geo> (“little vineyard by the sea”) has a pair of pleasant
hotels and several restaurants, making it a good place to spend the
night. A small lane twists down to a rocky cove and small beach, while
another reaches the sea at <geo  id='6476025'>Port</geo> d’es Canonge.
North of <geo  id='2521361'>Banyalbufar</geo>, the road turns inland for a while.
Just off the road, in the direction of <geo  id='2517880'>Esporles</geo>, you’ll find La Granja,
a popular tourist attraction and good family stop that is part stately
home, part finca (traditional farmhouse), and part craft center.
The town of <geo  id='2509929'>Valldemossa</geo> was transformed by the short visit,
over a century and a half ago, of French writer George Sand and her
lover, Frédéric Chopin. Their few weeks here in the winter of 1838–1839
seem to have been fairly miserable: Chopin was unwell, the weather was
wet and cold and bad for his chest, and George Sand disparaged the
villagers in her book A Winter in <geo  id='6453300'>Majorca</geo>, calling them “barbarians and
thieves. ” She nicknamed <geo  id='6453300'>Mallorca</geo> “Monkey Island. ”
Now, busloads of visitors arrive daily in this picturesque
mountain village to see the couple’s lodgings in the former Carthusian
monastery La Cartuja. The monks were expelled in 1835, and some of
their cells were sold as holiday apartments. (The “cells” were in fact
three-room suites with private gardens. ) The two cells the lovers
rented are now a museum, with original manuscripts, Chopin’s death
mask, and his piano. You’ll see, too, the massive church, the monks’
pharmacy with its collection of 18th-century jars, their library, and
the guests’ dining room.
In great contrast to George Sand’s negative impressions of
<geo  id='6453300'>Mallorca</geo> was the lifelong love affair that the Austrian Archduke Ludwig
Salvator (or Luis Salvador) had with the Balearics and their people. In
1870 he bought the estate of <geo  id='11257997'>Son Marroig</geo> just outside Deià, which he
proudly proclaimed the most beautiful place on <geo  id='6295630'>earth</geo>. The house, open
to visitors, is filled with his collections. In the gardens, take in
the bird’s-eye view from the cliff-edge temple built out of Italian
marble. Hundreds of feet below the house is <geo  id='2511622'>Sa Foradada</geo> (literally,
“rock with a hole in it”), a rocky promontory jutting into the sea,
pierced by a remarkable 18-m- (60-ft-) wide natural window. If you feel
energetic, hop the little fence just south of <geo  id='11257997'>Son Marroig</geo> and take the
half-hour’s walk down to the sea and the landing stage where the
archduke Salvator used to anchor his yacht.
Deià, a gorgeous hilltop town of honey-colored stone and
brightly painted shutters just east of <geo  id='11257997'>Son Marroig</geo>, has attracted
plenty of artists and assorted expatriates ever since Robert Graves,
the poet and author of I, Claudius, came to live here with Laura Riding
in 1929. Graves was pursued by a strange coterie of admirers and late
in life became the Grand Old Man of Deià, fierce in his defense of the
northwest coast against touristic exploitation. He convinced the
Minister of Tourism, a friend, to declare the area a nature reserve.
The picture-perfect town is extremely popular in summer, when the
year-round population of 613 swells with the trendy and chic who drive
up rents by taking houses in Deià. Besides fancy luxury hotels in old
manor houses, there are a couple of smart, low-cost alternatives, and
one of the best rosters of restaurants on the coast, making Deià an
ideal base for a few overnights. At the top of the village, near the
church is a small cemetery overlooking the Mediterranean; a simple
cement slab bears the inscription: Robert Graves, Poeta, 1895–1985.
It’s a twisting 2-km (1-mile) drive down to Deià’s tiny
fishing cove (Cala de Deià), where ladder-like ramps come out of the
boathouses set into the cliffs. A snack bar and a beach café open in
summer, but the rocky shore can get choked with seaweed and tourists
who’d hoped to find a private cove. Just beyond the turnoff to Cala de
Deià is Llucalcari, which isn’t properly signposted; look for the sign
that says, simply, “Hotel” off to the left side of the road. The tiny
village has but six or seven houses, several of them fortified with
coats of armor emblazoned on the doors, but if you’re up to an
adventurous hike down the hill, hurdling a couple of gates property
owners have installed to ward off crowds, you’ll discover a rocky
section of shoreline with pristine, transparent waters ideal for
swimming.
At <geo  id='2510821'>Sóller</geo> and its seaside twin <geo  id='2518244'>Port de Sóller</geo>, the cliffs
and mountains at last relent. The largest bay on the northwest coast
makes a fine harbor, but both the water and the beach can be dirty.
Sheltered slopes a few miles inland are covered in groves of lemon,
orange, almond, and olive trees, with the island’s highest mountain,
<geo  id='2513992'>Puig Major</geo> (1,445 m. /4,740 ft), as a rugged backdrop. <geo  id='2510821'>Sóller</geo> is a
busy, prosperous town that claims, like several others, that it was the
birthplace of Columbus. <geo  id='2510821'>Sóller</geo> and <geo  id='2512989'>Palma</geo> are linked by the narrow-gauge
<geo  id='2510821'>Sóller</geo> Railway, built in 1912. Five times a day (six on Sundays),
polished wooden trains make the hour-long journey in each direction
through orchards and spectacular mountain scenery, stopping at Son
Sardina and Bunyola. The 10:40am tren turístico from <geo  id='2512989'>Palma</geo> takes in an
extra scenic halt above <geo  id='2510821'>Sóller</geo>, allowing travelers to snap their
shutters before moving on (otherwise, the trip is the same, except for
the price).
In a valley of orange orchards and olive groves, <geo  id='2510821'>Sóller</geo> is
a compact little town of well-preserved 18th- and 19th-century mansions
and agreeable churches and convents. The main square, Plaça
Constitució, is a good place to idle for a while and absorb the
appealing character of the town. A walk down Gran Vía reveals buildings
with Art Nouveau and neo-Baroque flourishes, constructed during the
town’s early-20th-century expansion.
Two tiny and handsome villages near <geo  id='2510821'>Sóller</geo> have enticed
foreigners to acquire many of the medieval houses. Fornalutx is a jewel
of warm stone so immaculate that it won a national prize a few years
ago for spotlessness. Its steep cobblestone streets are lined with
cacti and palm trees, and the <geo  id='9171199'>Tramuntana</geo> mountains soar in the
background. Similarly set among orange trees and wild flowers,
Biniaraix is only a short stroll away down narrow lanes.
Authorities felt that the road from <geo  id='2512989'>Palma</geo> to <geo  id='2510821'>Sóller</geo>, with
its hairpin bends and the 496-m (1,627-ft) pass, the <geo  id='2510819'>Coll de Sóller</geo>,
was impeding development. In spite of vigorous protests from
environmentalists, plans were approved for a road tunnel under the
mountains, and digging began in 1990. Travel time to <geo  id='2512989'>Palma</geo> has been
reduced to about a half-hour.
On the southern slope, right opposite the tunnel entrance,
are the Jardins d’Alfabia, a seigneurial mansion and gardens that were
once the country estate of the Moorish Vizier of <geo  id='2512989'>Palma</geo>. These days, the
cisterns, fountains, and irrigation channels are a tad run down, but
the flowing water and shaded walks, turkeys feeding under fig trees,
and birds singing among exotic plants exude a gentle appeal. The house
is like a forgotten palace, full of neglected treasures. Don’t miss the
huge wooden 14th-century oak chair in the print room, called by one
expert “the most important antique in <geo  id='6453300'>Mallorca</geo>. ”
The mountainous country to the east, reached via a lovely
drive past Bunyola, is a favorite with hikers and walkers based at the
tiny village of Orient or on daytrips from the coast. A massive
mountain crag 822 m (2,700 ft) high is crowned by the Castell d’Alaró,
a ruined fortress built by King Jaume I during the Moorish era. You can
make the long walk from Orient, or drive most of the way to the summit
up narrow and tortuous lanes, starting a little north of Alaró. The
higher they climb, the rougher and narrower the tracks get (but most
standard rental vehicles are capable of the trek). There’s a restaurant
and car park off to the left. The final ascent is on foot, up rocky
paths; wear sturdy walking shoes. Look for the sign that reads Castell
a Peu (To the castle on foot). It’s a vigorous 30- to 45-minute climb.
The gates and walls of the castle still guard the clifftop, and the
views of the mountains and surrounding plains are as thrilling as any
on <geo  id='6453300'>Mallorca</geo>.
Forced away from the sea by the steep terrain, the main
road north from <geo  id='2510821'>Sóller</geo> climbs over the high pass of Coll de <geo  id='2512162'>Puig</geo>
Major — the <geo  id='2513835'>Mirador</geo> de Ses Barques has fine views of the coast and <geo  id='2518244'>Port
de Sóller</geo>, as well as a restaurant — and past the dams and reservoirs
of Cuber and Gorg Blau. Near the second dam, a little road leads to the
coast. Its name, Sa Calobra (“the snake”), gives a hint of the 13 km (8
miles) of hairpin bends that have now become a tourist attraction in
themselves; one loop is so exaggerated that the road passes under
itself in a knot. Early morning is the best time to avoid the traffic
(the most harrowing part of the descent is avoiding road-hogging,
dangerous looking tourist buses). As a reward at the bottom of the
winding road, Cala de Sa Calobra has a couple of restaurants, bars, and
a pebbly beach, but all tend to be overcrowded with daytrippers. The
main objective is the deep gorge of Torrent de Pareis (“the twins”).
Tunnels, enlarged from natural crevices in the rock, burrow through to
the riverbed where the gorge widens into a natural theater (concerts
are given on some summer evenings).
At the Monasteri de Lluc, <geo  id='6453300'>Mallorca</geo>’s most revered place of
pilgrimage, foreign visitors are for once frequently outnumbered by
locals. The monastery, sequestered in a valley near the <geo  id='2512162'>Puig</geo> des
Castellot mountain, was founded in the 13th century, but the massive
buildings you see today date from the 17th and 18th centuries.
Islanders come to see and pray to a statue of the Madonna and Child, La
Moreneta (or “little dark one”), so called because of its dark stone
color. If you can attend mass in the church, you may hear the famous
Lluc boys’ choir, Es Blavets (“the blue ones”), named after the color
of their cassocks. The monastery is a popular place with inexpensive
accommodations, especially for hikers.
NORTHEAST: CAPES AND BAYS
The northwest coast isn’t short on beauty or drama, but
beaches are few and far between. Many visitors who seek beach time in
<geo  id='6453300'>Mallorca</geo> — a pretty reasonable desire, after all — beeline for the
northeast coast and its two great sandy bays, which have picturesque
mountainous backdrops and are within easy striking distance of the
historic towns <geo  id='6533963'>Pollença</geo> and <geo  id='6533929'>Alcúdia</geo>, as well as the protected wetlands
s’Albufera. The bays of <geo  id='6533963'>Pollença</geo> and <geo  id='6533929'>Alcúdia</geo> are lively and full of
visitors, many of them families, during a long and hospitable summer
season.
Pleasant <geo  id='6355021'>Port de Pollença</geo> is the kind of place that, in
contrast to much of the south, gives <geo  id='6453300'>Mallorca</geo> a good name — with a
perfectly sheltered, gently sloping sandy beach, a decent spectrum of
hotels, hostals, apartments, and villas, good seafood restaurants, and
relaxed nightlife options. Wedged in between two rocky promontories,
it’s a scenic place with luxury craft in the harbor and flotillas of
windsurfers in the bay.
Nearly every visitor to these parts ventures a bit farther
northeast to the spectacular cliffs of Península de <geo  id='6544445'>Formentor</geo>, the
narrow headland jutting out 13 km (8 miles) on the north side of the
bay. The best place to take in the extraordinary lunar landscape is the
<geo  id='2513835'>Mirador</geo> de Mal Pas, about 4 km (21/2 miles) from <geo  id='6355021'>Port de Pollença</geo> along
an adventurous, twisting road. Sheer cliffs plunge dramatically to the
Mediterranean, and the cape juts out to sea. Most boats and cars also
stop at the pretty, pine-shaded beach (Platja de <geo  id='6544445'>Formentor</geo>), a favorite
spot for a picnic and swimming. The beach enjoys splendid views across
the <geo  id='2512431'>Badia de Pollença</geo> — the same you’d get with a night’s stay at the
exclusive Hotel Formentor, whose manicured gardens are visible from the
beach.
From the turnoff to beach parking, it’s another 6.5 km (4
miles) to the lighthouse out on <geo  id='2517687'>Cap de Formentor</geo>. The road, swamped
with cars, bicyclists, and tour buses, can be tortuous, as they all try
to squeeze into the tiny parking lot at the top. As great as the views
are, on a crowded day it may be advisable to turn off after 2.5 km (1.5
miles) from the top. There you’ll find a single trek path down to <geo  id='2520575'>Cala
Figuera</geo>, a tiny cove with piercingly blue waters and a small beach
framed by the rocky masses of <geo  id='6544445'>Formentor</geo>.
A few miles inland from the sea, <geo  id='6533963'>Pollença</geo> was founded in
1230 after the defeat of the Moors. Until 1802 the town belonged to the
Order of the Knights of St. John, whose influence is evident in many
handsome stone buildings in the center. The town has a tranquil,
inviting atmosphere, especially at the outdoor cafes of Plaça
Major.
Whether <geo  id='6533963'>Pollença</geo>’s tiny bridge labeled Pont Roman is really
Roman is questionable, but the locals say so, and it certainly looks
the part. But the town’s principal sight is the Via Crucis (Way of the
Cross), a long, steep climb of 365 steps, lined with 365 cypress trees,
that lead to El Calvari and the venerated church with a rhyming name,
Mare de Déu del Peu de la Creu (Mother of God at the Foot of the
Cross). If you’re driving, there’s also a road up, which passes the 14
Stations of the Cross.
One of the finest walks on <geo  id='6453300'>Mallorca</geo> can be made only on
Saturdays. From <geo  id='6533963'>Pollença</geo>, head north, taking the narrow road towards
Ternelles. Cars usually can go just a short distance before reaching a
checkpoint where they have to turn back. However, on Saturdays during
spring and autumn the landowners open their “frontier” to allow only
walkers to go through (even cyclists are prohibited). The route follows
the gorge of the Torrent de Ternelles at first, then turns off to head
for the ruined Castell del Rei, built by the Moors on a soaring crag
500 m (1,640 ft) above the sea. Another rough track leads down to the
shore at <geo  id='6358192'>Cala</geo> Castell. The entire hike is about 13 km (8 miles).
Between Pollença and <geo  id='6355021'>Port de Pollença</geo> is the turnoff for
Cala Sant Vicenç, a gleaming resort situated ar ound three gorgeous
sandy coves with brilliant blue water, excellent for swimming and
snorkeling. The setting, framed by the craggy <geo  id='2510940'>Serra</geo> de Comayaques and
El Morral mountains, is spectacular — excellent for both families and
day hikers.
Astride the neck of land between the Bay of <geo  id='6533963'>Pollença</geo> and
the even more expansive Bay of <geo  id='6533929'>Alcúdia</geo> stands the ancient walled town
of <geo  id='6533929'>Alcúdia</geo>, first inhabited by the Phoenicians in the eighth century
b.c. The Romans then built their capital, Pollentia, here. Too close to
the sea for safety from raids, it must have depended on its impressive
fortifications for protection (the massive walls you see today are mere
imitations of the originals. ) The sturdy Gothic church of Sant <geo  id='9169561'>Jaume</geo>
forms the southern bastion in the walls.
Beyond the road that circles the town you can see the low
ruins remaining from Roman Pollentia. They’re not impressive as such
sites go, but some fine relics excavated here are now displayed in the
little Museu Monogràfic, a nicely restored building opposite Sant <geo  id='9169561'>Jaume</geo>
church. Just off the road leading from <geo  id='6533929'>Alcúdia</geo> to its port is the
Teatre Romà (Roman theater), hewn out of solid rock in the first
century b.c.
<geo  id='6544075'>Port d’Alcúdia</geo> has evolved from a small fishing harbor into
an all-purpose port for commercial, naval, and pleasure craft (there’s
a big yacht marina) and the largest summer resort in northern <geo  id='6453300'>Mallorca</geo>.
Restaurants and discos have multiplied, as have hotels and apartment
blocks, which now spread around the bay to form an almost unbroken
ribbon of buildings 10 km (6 miles) long. Platja d’<geo  id='6533929'>Alcúdia</geo> in summer a
solid block of bodies soaking up the sun. Though big and crowded, the
resort remains pretty low-key, a good option for families with restless
children.
Remarkably, so close to a major resort, lie the precious
wetlands of S’Albufera are a haven for birdlife. Drainage plans in the
19th century ran into such problems that the British company
responsible for a network of canals, paths, and bridges — still to be
seen today — went bust. Much of the bay was originally surrounded by
swampland, until development plans prompted large-scale reclamation.
S’Albufera was one of the beneficiaries of the new environmental
consciousness in <geo  id='6453300'>Mallorca</geo>. You can now walk or cycle among the 800
hectares (2,000 acres) of wetlands and dunes that have been designated
a Parc Natural (nature reserve), keeping a lookout for some of the more
than 200 species of birds that have been spotted here.
EAST COAST: COVES AND CAVES
<geo  id='6453300'>Mallorca</geo>’s eastern coastline attracts nearly as many
sun-seeking tourists as the extended Bay of <geo  id='2512989'>Palma</geo> in the southwest.
It’s generally less seedy, if not much less crowded. Tiny harbors, some
no more than a cleft in the cliffs, alternate with larger bays. Here
and there, great clusters of villas are transformed from ghost town to
boom town as soon as summer arrives.
Cala Ratjada is about as far as you can get from <geo  id='2512989'>Palma</geo>
without having to take to the water. But the water is what most people
are here for, whether it’s the fishermen, catamaran sailors, or the
beach-bound vacationers. The resort is lively but undistinguished in
appearance. Only the tourist information office (Tel. 971/56 30 33) can
arrange a visit to the Joan March Sculpture Garden, on the grounds of
the coastal mansion. March collected important works by Rodin, Henry
Moore, Anthony Caro, and many modern Spanish masters.
Fine sandy beaches are close by at Cala Gat and Cala Moltó,
though most of the bathers head to Platja Son Moll, lined by large
hotels. Up on Cap <geo  id='6533938'>Capdepera</geo> there’s a lighthouse with fine views of the
coast. If it’s clear, you’ll be able to see Menorca. The cape takes its
name from nearby <geo  id='6533938'>Capdepera</geo>, a storybook town with crenellated
battlements of the 14th-century castle (<geo  id='11257181'>Castell de Capdepera</geo>) on the
hill above the town.
The agreeable country town of Artà, 8 km (5 miles) inland,
seems far removed from the tourism that rules farther down the coast.
Steps lead up Way of the Cross to the fortified church of Santuari de
Sant Salvador, where you are rewarded with a fine view of the town,
hills, and coast.
A sign pointing down a side road in the southern outskirts
of <geo  id='6533931'>Artà</geo> says simply “Talaiot,” but it leads to one of <geo  id='6453300'>Mallorca</geo>’s most
important Megalithic settlements, <geo  id='7304052'>Ses Paisses</geo>.
Some distance away on the coast, <geo  id='6533931'>Artà</geo> has given its name to
the limestone caves called Coves d’<geo  id='6533931'>Artà</geo>. The Coves de Drac, further
down the eastern coast, get more fanfare, but the less commercial <geo  id='6533931'>Artà</geo>
caves allow visitors to get closer and better appreciate the awesome
formations that have been brewing for millennia. Colored lights and
Bach’s organ music point up the name given to the lowest level, “The
Inferno. ” Jules Verne is said to have been inspired by a visit here to
write Journey to the Center of the <geo  id='6295630'>Earth</geo>.
Two groups of caves in the vicinity of Porto Cristo make a
cool change from the beach — and attract an interminable procession of
tour buses. The overcommercialized Coves del Drac (Caves of the
Dragon), to the south of the port, contain almost 2 km (more than a
mile) of huge chambers and spectacular formations, as well as the
unquestionable highlight — a 177-m- (581-ft-) long underground lake
named after Edouard-Alfred Martel, the French speleologist who explored
the caves in 1896. There’s no denying the grandeur of the formations
and their atmospheric lighting. The grand finale seems spectacular to
some and completely unnecessary to others: The lights in the
amphitheater dim and three rowboats decked out with Christmas lights
paddle out to the middle of the lake, one with an organist and two
violinists playing classical music. If you wish, after the concerto you
can hop one of the boats yourself and go for a little spin across the
water.
Cala d’Or came early to the resort business, and it has now
evolved into a huge complex encompassing several individual coves and
resorts, with all the facilities and watersports you could ask for. In
contrast, nearby Porto Petro still looks like a traditional fishing
village, though it, too, is not immune from the summertime tourist
invasion.
<geo  id='6692451'>Cala Mondragó</geo> is practically undeveloped (by the standards
of coastal <geo  id='6453300'>Mallorca</geo>), and may stay that way by order of the regional
government, which has become alarmed by the specter of unchecked
building along the coast. One of the gems that first attracted visitors
to this part, <geo  id='2520575'>Cala Figuera</geo> is still delightful, with neat
green-and-white houses and unpretentious boats lining its Y-shaped
inlet.
THE SOUTH
Until recently, few visitors knew (or wanted to know)
anything of <geo  id='6453300'>Mallorca</geo>’s deep south. Many of the coastal resorts that do
exist are mundane, while large sections of the shoreline are simply
inhospitable. The long sandy beach and dunes of Es Trenc, the south’s
best beach, were left to the islanders to enjoy. The situation is
changing somewhat, but it appears that major development won’t be
permitted.
Cap de <geo  id='6533976'>Ses Salines</geo>, the island’s southernmost point, takes
its name from the local salt flats and ponds, where many bird-watchers
gather in the spring to see the migrants on the way north from <geo  id='6255146'>Africa</geo>.
<geo  id='2519340'>Colònia de Sant Jordi</geo> is lined with hotels and villas, but it seems a
rather half-hearted attempt at a resort. The nearby harbor serves as
the starting point for trips to <geo  id='9178694'>Cabrera</geo>, a tiny island usually visible
17 km (10 miles) to the south. Visits are limited to parties of
bird-watchers or zoologists and to excursion groups.
Some 5 km (3 miles) inland from <geo  id='6951054'>Cala Pi</geo> is Capocorp Vell,
the most remarkable of <geo  id='6453300'>Mallorca</geo>’s Megalithic settlements, situated 6 km
(4 miles) from Cap Blanc on the road towards <geo  id='6533952'>Llucmajor</geo>. From as early
as 1200 b.c. massive stones were being cut and hauled into place to
build a village. The five talaiots (three round towers, two square) may
have been added later.
THE INTERIOR
The name given <geo  id='6453300'>Mallorca</geo>’s vast interior, Es Pla (“the
plain”), may not sound promising. And in fact, it doesn’t slow down the
great majority of visitors who stampede across the middle of <geo  id='6453300'>Mallorca</geo>
in a mad dash to their assigned piece of coastline. Es Pla is lightly
populated and little geared toward tourism. Still, there are lovely
agricultural landscapes with ancient stone fincas (farmhouses),
terraced olive groves, farmers who still plough with horses, leisurely
back roads, and unassuming old towns. It’s an area best covered by your
own transportation, either automobile or bicycle.
Northeast of <geo  id='2512989'>Palma</geo> is the attractive town of <geo  id='6533933'>Binissalem</geo>,
the epicenter of <geo  id='6453300'>Mallorca</geo>’s wine industry (which earned a Denominación
de Origen — a quality designation similar to the French Apellation
d’Origine — in 1991). The town features a number of attractive
townhouses dating from the 17th and 18th centuries. Farther along the
main road heading northeast is the unattractive industrial town of
Inca, center of the leather industry. The best reason to visit is to
shop at the factory outlets. Inca’s Thursday market sprawls through the
streets, and tour buses arrive in flotillas, even though the goods are
much the same as in other markets on the island.
Just north of Inca is the tiny town of Caimari, worth a
quick detour to take in the amazing hillside of terraced olive groves,
neatly layered among ancient stones.
<geo  id='6533977'>Sineu</geo>, practically at the center of the island, is probably
the pick of inland towns. Built on the site King Jaume II chose to
build a palace (which survives, now much altered, as a convent), <geo  id='6533977'>Sineu</geo>
has an elegant Gothic church, some attractive seigneurial homes, and a
pleasant central plaza with some good restaurants. Wednesday is market
day, when people come from all over Es Pla for fresh produce and
livestock.
In <geo  id='6533945'>Felanitx</geo>, the honey-colored church Sant Miquel dates in
part from the 13th century. In the street adjacent is a stone tablet
commemorating a tragedy: During an Easter procession in 1844, the
collapse of a wall killed 414 people. <geo  id='6533945'>Felanitx</geo> is the starting point
for a bracing trip to Castell de Santueri, a ruined hilltop castle that
was fortified by every ruler from Roman times to the 17th century. Take
the exhilarating walk round the ramparts — there’s nothing between you
and a dizzying precipice. The views of the coast are superb, and on a
rare clear day you’ll see Menorca and Ibiza, too.
On the next hill to the north — and unless you’re a serious
walker you’ll have to go back through <geo  id='6533945'>Felanitx</geo> to reach it — the <geo  id='2512162'>Puig</geo>
de Sant <geo  id='3585968'>Salvador</geo> is the site of a hermitage and one of <geo  id='6453300'>Mallorca</geo>’s most
important places of pilgrimage. In the church, look behind the altar at
the Gothic statue of the Virgin Mary, backed by an alabaster panel of
blond angels.
Suddenly rearing up out of the flat lands south of <geo  id='2522036'>Algaida</geo>,
the 542-m- (1,778-ft-) high <geo  id='2512162'>Puig</geo> de Randa is crowned by a monastery
founded in the 13th century by the Mallorcan sage Ramón Llull.
<geo  id='6453301'>MENORCA</geo>
For many years, Menorca — one-fifth the area of <geo  id='6453300'>Mallorca</geo>,
with a tenth the population — was one of the best-kept secrets in the
Mediterranean. While it still receives only about one visitor for every
eight that <geo  id='6453300'>Mallorca</geo> does, the secret’s out of the bag. Occupied by the
British in the 18th century, <geo  id='6453301'>Menorca</geo> remains hugely popular with
English package tourists, retirees, and vacation homeowners.
The capital and largest town, <geo  id='2514301'>Maó</geo> (<geo  id='6533953'>Mahón</geo> in Spanish), and
the former capital <geo  id='3124967'><geo  id='3124967'><geo  id='3124967'>Ciutadella</geo></geo></geo> are on opposite coasts. Resort
development is restricted to a handful of coves and beaches on the
southeast coast and the west coast. Like a fish’s backbone, one main
road only 44 km (26 miles) long links <geo  id='6453301'>Menorca</geo>’s two main cities with
coves, resorts, and beaches — as well as a handful of tiny towns — on
the north or south coasts connected to it by a web of mostly one-lane
roads. Many coves and beaches can be reached only by foot. <geo  id='6453301'>Menorca</geo>’s
many Talaiotic monuments are scattered across the island, though
they’re especially concentrated in the southeast.
<geo  id='2514301'>Maó</geo>
<geo  id='2514301'>Maó</geo> is the business and administrative capital of <geo  id='6453301'>Menorca</geo>,
but it remains, above all, a port. “ The best ports in the
Mediterranean are June, July, August, and Maó,” said the 16th-century
Venetian admiral Andrea Doria, noting that beyond the summer sailing
season, a fleet couldn’t do better than shelter here. The 6-km-
(4-mile-) long, deep-water natural harbor, guarded by forts at its
mouth and shielded from the winds by surrounding hills, caught the eye
of the British Royal Navy early in the 18th century. In 1708, during
the War of the Spanish Succession, the British seized the island for
its port, and kept possession until temporarily losing it to the French
in 1756.
British occupation, on and off until 1802, left its mark.
The English introduced gin, and Menorcan gin production has thrived
ever since (see page 96). Parts of <geo  id='2514301'>Maó</geo>’s old town appear straight out
of Georgian <geo  id='6269131'>England</geo>. Whole streets, including Costa de Sa Plaça
(Hannover), resemble 18th-century <geo  id='2639996'>Portsmouth</geo> or <geo  id='2640194'>Plymouth</geo>.
The only way to enjoy <geo  id='2514301'>Maó</geo> is by foot. The city is clustered
on a cliff; near the center, a twisting roadway (Costa de <geo  id='10278623'>Ses Voltes</geo>)
and flights of broad ceremonial steps lead down to the quays and port.
<geo  id='2514301'>Maó</geo>’s star sight is its beautiful port, and the enjoyable promenade and
restaurants and pastel-colored houses that line it.
At the top level, follow your nose to Plaça d’<geo  id='2510769'>Espanya</geo> and
the fish market, where you’ll see more varieties of octopus and squid
than you knew existed. Adjacent are a produce market and stalls, housed
in the vast cloisters (Claustre del Carme) of a former convent, selling
Abarcas (Menorcan peasant shoes), jewelry, and Menorca’s famous Mahón
cheese. Made of cow’s milk with a small percentage of sheep’s milk,
varieties range from the young and mild to a hard-skinned and almost
crystalline, long-matured version rivaling the best Parmesan.
The chief landmark in this area, on Plaça de la Conquesta,
is the church of Santa María, a large Gothic space under a vaulted
roof. Rebuilt in the 18th century, it was equipped in 1810 with a
Baroque, 3,000-pipe organ — still played during organ concerts every
morning but Sunday. Just round the corner, the stately Ajuntament (Town
Hall) is graced by a clock presented by Sir Richard Kane (1713–1736),
<geo  id='6453301'>Menorca</geo>’s first British governor.
Elegant Carrer Isabel II, a long string of mansions
overlooking the harbor, leads to leads to the Baroque church Església
<geo  id='2511387'>Sant Francesc</geo> and the Museu de <geo  id='6453301'>Menorca</geo>. The façade of <geo  id='2511387'>Sant Francesc</geo>,
completed in the 18th century, conceals a delightful Churrigueresque
<geo  id='4350969'>Chapel of the Immaculate Conception</geo>. The museum, the best on <geo  id='6453301'>Menorca</geo>,
excels in its prehistoric and classical artifacts, which depict the
fascinating history of the island.
Between the museum and town hall, amid <geo  id='2514301'>Maó</geo>’s network of
narrow streets, is the Porto Sant Roc, one of the original city
gates.
The legacy of British gin can be seen — and tasted — at the
Xoriguer distillery, west of the ferry port. Established in the 18th
century, the distillery still operates, and you can look through big
windows at copper stills bubbling away, producing a hot, colorless
spirit, which is poured over juniper berries to become gin. You can
sample any number of liqueurs produced here, including calent (spiced
with saffron and cinnamon) and hierbas dulces, a bright green liquid
(and acquired taste) that restaurant owners may force upon you at
meal’s end.
Take a stroll along the quayside, past the foot of the
main steps, along Moll de <geo  id='305104'>Levant</geo> — where most of <geo  id='2514301'>Maó</geo>’s best restaurants
are located — and you’ll turn the corner into <geo  id='2520575'>Cala Figuera</geo> (called
“English Cove” in the days of the British Navy) and the Club Marítim,
where pleasure craft congregate near the ships’ chandlers, shops, and
restaurants that cater to them.
If you have time, take a glass-bottomed cruise from the
port or <geo  id='2520575'>Cala Figuera</geo> for the best views of Maó, the harbor islands, and
the forts on the shore. High in the hills of the north side is an
imposing pinkish-colored mansion, Sant Antoní. Part Georgian and
part Spanish style, the mansion is better known as Golden Farm. The
house is privately owned, so you’ll have to admire it from a
distance.
Looking out over the harbor mouth toward vast fo
rtifications on the opposite side (still used as a military base), <geo  id='6533981'>Es
Castell</geo> (also called <geo  id='2509607'>Villacarlos</geo>) appears even more English than <geo  id='2514301'>Maó</geo>.
There are some lively restaurants and bars along Moll de Sant Fonts at
the waterfront, and the Cala de Sant Fonts, a boardwalk cleaved into
the rock framing the harbor, makes for a delightful stroll.
Excursions from <geo  id='2514301'>Maó</geo>: South and East
If you set out from <geo  id='2514301'>Maó</geo>, the first of many Talaoitic
monuments is found near <geo  id='2643741'>the city</geo> limit, at Trepucó off the road south
to <geo  id='2511302'>Sant Lluís</geo>. The talaiot and taula at the site have been slightly
damaged, not least when the French army fortified it and mounted guns
to fire on the British in Fort San Felipe.
<geo  id='2511302'>Sant Lluis</geo>, a little town of checkerboard streets and
all-white, typically Menorcan houses, was built by the French army as
their headquarters in the Seven Years’ War (1756–1763).
The southeast, with its small sandy beaches, clear water,
and proximity to <geo  id='2514301'>Maó</geo> and its airport, was one of the first to be
developed for tourism. At S’Algar and <geo  id='7116490'>Cala d’Alcaufar</geo>, villas cluster
near a rocky shore, and <geo  id='6544354'>Punta Prima</geo> has a sandy but often unkempt
beach.
Though there’s little to distinguish many of these
resorts, Binibeca Vell (also spelled <geo  id='6692457'>Binibèquer Vell</geo>) is something
different. Vell means “old,” which in this case is a misnomer. Inspired
by a traditional Menorcan fishing village, a local architect created
this sun-splashed “toy-town” of brilliant white houses and dark wooden
beams and shutters in 1972.
Just up the coast from Binebeca are some of the
southeast’s finest beaches and swimming waters. Literally right next
door is an area known to locals as Las Ollas — the name means “frying
pans,” perhaps pertaining to the circular shape of this natural
swimming hole carved by the sea. More likely, though, the sobriquet
refers to the sound of the continually moving waters, sloshing against
a beautiful rock basin like sauces bubbling in a pan. The “pools” are
popular with nudist bathers.
The road makes detours inland on its way west to the
resorts of <geo  id='2520953'>Binidalí</geo> and fine protected coves Cala de Biniparratx and
Cala de <geo  id='2520953'>Binidalí</geo>. Both are small enough and sufficiently off the beaten
path that you’re unlikely to encounter large crowds. The former has a
platform at the edge of the sea, which provides excellent views of the
coast and back at the small cove. To get to Cala de Biniparratx, park
your car in the small lot and walk along a beautiful path through a
canyon and shrubs to a narrow cove. The beach is sheltered by steep
cliffs that house ancient cave dwellings.
Farther west along the coast is another spate of massive
development. Cala en Porter is one of the largest, oldest-established,
and, in season, loudest holiday towns on <geo  id='6453301'>Menorca</geo>. This villa
town — called an urbanització — is resolutely British. If you’re
looking for a pint of bitters and an English football game, you’ll have
no trouble finding it. Steps lead down the hill through sprawling
development to a rather nice, but crowded, sandy beach. Nearby is Cova
d’En Xoroi a cave carved in the steep cliff that has been converted
into a disco. You can dance the night away above a vertiginous drop to
the crashing sea. For those who are curious but not nocturnal, the
enterprising owner allows afternoon visits for a reduced cover
charge.
In contrast to Cala’En Porter, nearby Cales Coves is
undeveloped. Although no buildings survive, there’s evidence that it
was a port in Roman times. Cales Coves is best known, however, for its
amazing collection of caves — perhaps a hundred or more — burrowed out
of the cliffs. You can see the openings of caves once used as
necropolises (burial chambers) in the Talaiotic period; today some of
them provide shelter for dropouts and backpackers.
North Coast
Wild, rocky, and deeply indented, much of the north coast
can’t be reached by road at all. Immediately north of <geo  id='2514301'>Maó</geo> is the Cap de
Favàrritx, a barren cape with a lighthouse. Down the coast is the
attractive beach at Cala Presili and, inland, S’Albufera, a wetlands
nature reserve distinguished by a freshwater lake, migrant birds, and
sand dunes. From the small resort of Es Grau, with beaches and swimming
waters popular with families, it’s possible to hire a boat to go to the
beaches of rocky <geo  id='10346552'>Illa d’En Colom</geo> (Pigeon Island).
The twin coves of <geo  id='8410759'>Port d’Addaia</geo> — now a holiday village
and harbor — were the site of the last British invasion in 1798, by
Scottish Highland troops who probably thought these rocky hillsides
covered with purple heather were just like home. You can drive down to
the sea at only a few places, and inevitably some of these have
developed rapidly into sprawling resorts. Na Macaret was an old fishing
village, and much of the new development seeks to imitate a traditional
look, especially around the neat little square. <geo  id='8063789'>Arenal d’En Castell</geo> has
a beautiful circular bay, almost enclosed and with a wide sandy
beach.
Nearby Son Parc, near a big, flat sandy beach backed by
dunes, is an artificial creation centered around a golf club, the only
one of its kind on <geo  id='6453301'>Menorca</geo>. For greater authenticity, head back to the
Maó-Fornells road and onto Fornells, which remains a real fishing
village. This low-key town, a good base for exploring the north coast,
is lined by pretty houses and ballyhooed seafood restaurants along the
waterfront. The inlet’s sheltered coastline and shallow water make it
ideal for sailing and windsurfing.
For geological extremes, take the rough and pothole-ridden
track to the most northerly point on the island, Cap de Cavallería.
It’s passable by car, with a farm gate to open and close, and leads
past the site of the ancient Carthaginian and Roman port of Sanitja.
Walk along the sheer drop of the clifftop near the lighthouse for
breathtaking views.
Back down the hellish road from the cape, and due west, is
the isolated beach Platja Binimella. Menorcans favor the orange-tinged
sand-and-pebble beach on weekends. But if it’s beaches you’re after,
you cannot do better on <geo  id='6453301'>Menorca</geo> (or just about anywhere) than Cala
Pregonda. You can only get here by scrambling over the hills just west
of Binimella. About 20 minutes later, having passed through a desert
landscape, you will have discovered paradise: a spectacular sandy beach
framed by a lush pine forest and stalagmite-like sea stacks rising out
of impossibly transparent waters.
West from <geo  id='2514301'>Maó</geo>: Taloitic Monuments and Inland Towns
From <geo  id='2514301'>Maó</geo>, plenty of people blitz right across Menorca to
<geo  id='3124967'>Ciutadella</geo> — only 45 km (27 miles) and a direct shot, it takes less
than an hour. The busy main road from <geo  id='2514301'>Maó</geo> to <geo  id='3124967'><geo  id='3124967'>Ciutadella</geo></geo> at first runs
parallel to the one built by order of the first British governor, the
Camí d’En Kane. The scenic and well-paved old road passes a number of
handsome haciendas. Beyond <geo  id='6533928'>Alaior</geo>, the modern road is superimposed on
the old route.
Near <geo  id='2514301'>Maó</geo>, you can begin a tour of <geo  id='6453301'>Menorca</geo>’s mysterious
3,000-year-old megalithic sites. Just 3 km (2 miles) from <geo  id='2514301'>Maó</geo>, a
lavender sign to the left points down a lane to Talatí de Dalt. Hop the
small wall and walk through groves to discover an elegantly slim taula
with a fallen stone supporting the base — which has led some to
speculate that it was formed this way for a reason. (In all likelihood,
the piece merely fell). Next to the taula is a dark columned room and
nearby burial caves. The settlement here dates to the end of the Bronze
Age, around 1400 b.c.
Back on the main road, a little farther west, keep an eye
on the fields on the north side. You’re looking for <geo  id='2512075'>Rafal</geo> <geo  id='6356209'>Rubí</geo>, a site
with two stone structures shaped like upturned boats, navetas
(prehistoric burial chambers). These were collective ossuaries, used
for secondary burials of bones. If you crawl through the low doorway of
the better-restored naveta, you can appreciate the spacious interior,
over 2 m (7 ft) high, with shelves at each end. The other naveta is
more of a ruin, but worth seeing for the beautifully recessed stone
door frame, evidently designed to take a stone or wooden door.
South of the road, and most easily accessible by the
narrow lane from <geo  id='6533928'>Alaior</geo> to Cala En Porter, is the fascinating Talaoitic
complex <geo  id='6357537'>Torralba</geo> d’En Salord. <geo  id='6357537'>Torralba</geo> has perhaps the most beautiful
taula of all — certain evidence that the ancients were masters of the
<geo  id='9171599'>art</geo> of stone construction. Recent excavations and radiocarbon dating
put the taula’s date at about 900 b.c. The “Hypostyle hall” has one of
the few intact stone roofs supported by columns. This site is one of
the only ones on the island to charge admission and keep set hours.
The town of <geo  id='6533928'>Alaior</geo>, a mass of white houses clustered on a
low hill, looks at a distance like an Arab or Andalusian village. The
old section of town, at the top, is the most attractive quarter. <geo  id='6533928'>Alaior</geo>
is famous for its cheese-making industry; stop at either the Coinga or
La Payesa factory for a sample of queso de Mahón. To the south of town,
a long, sandy, gently sloping beach and sand dunes have brought
obtrusive high-rise hotel and villa developments to the south coast at
<geo  id='2979397'>Sant Jaume</geo> and Platja de Son Bou. Besides waterslides and windsurfers,
the outline of a fifth-century basilica discovered in 1951, is visible
next to the beach at its eastern end.
A turnoff from the <geo  id='6533928'>Alaior</geo>–Son Bou road, signposted to
Torre d’En Gaumés, brings you to the second largest and most varied of
Menorca’s prehistoric settlements. Don’t miss the hypostyle court, with
its central supports and massive roof intact, or the water cisterns
carved out in the soft sandstone rock.
Choose a clear day and head for <geo  id='6533958'>Es Mercadal</geo>, halfway along
the main east–west highway (9 km/5 miles from <geo  id='6533928'>Alaior</geo>). Here, climb the
twisting but well-contoured road to the top of Monte El Toro, <geo  id='6453301'>Menorca</geo>’s
highest peak. It’s only 357 m (1,171 ft) high, but provides excellent
views of the entire island.
A horseshoe-shaped cove with white sand and turquoise
water sheltered by cliffs and green pine woods has made the stunningly
beautiful Cala Santa Galdana one of <geo  id='6453301'>Menorca</geo>’s most popular holiday
destinations. To escape the crowds, take the path from the parking lot
opposite the Hotel Gavilanes (disregard the sign that says Coto Privado
de Caza — private hunting grounds) and walk 20 minutes through the
woods along a fairly well-defined path. You’ll come to Cala Mitjana, a
secluded but popular beach. If you try to drive here, you’ll have to
pay to travel the access road.
<geo  id='3124967'>Ciutadella</geo>
Perhaps the most enchanting city of the Balearics,
<geo  id='3124967'>Ciutadella</geo> — with its sandstone buildings, churches, and cobblestone
streets — preserves the flavor of a Spanish colonial island town. Until
the early 18th century, <geo  id='3124967'>Ciutadella</geo> (“little city”) was the capital of
Menorca. The British, on the island mainly for Maó’s harbor, moved the
capital in 1722. <geo  id='3124967'>Ciutadella</geo>’s beautiful but narrow and shallow inlet
simply could not compete.
Plaça Alfons III, on the eastern edge of town, marks the
spot where the road from <geo  id='2514301'>Maó</geo> reached the old city gates. The gates are
long gone, but the cafés around the square — including the atmospheric
Es Molí in an ancient windmill — probably began by refreshing thirsty
travelers. Locals flood the old town in early evening. Join them on
their paseo and stroll along the main, pedestrian-only street that
bisects the old part of the city. It takes various names, beginning as
Carrer de <geo  id='2514301'>Maó</geo>; at Sa Plaça Nova it becomes Carrer J. María Quadrado,
one side of which — the lovely <geo  id='10278623'>Ses Voltes</geo> — is completely arcaded in
Moorish style and lined with shops and restaurants.
On Plaça de la Catedral is the stately Gothic cathedral,
begun in the 13th century on the site of the old mosque. The bishop’s
palace adjoins the church. <geo  id='3124967'>Ciutadella</geo>’s tourist information office is
just across the plaza from the cathedral. The pedestrian-only streets
of the Es Rodal area just south of the cathedral are replete with
wonderful stonework, the buildings’ honey color glowing gold as the sun
goes down. Look especially for the carved doorway of the 17th-century
church Església del Roser down the side street carrer del Roser (across
from the cathedral) and two 17th-century palaces, <geo  id='2988743'>Palau</geo> <geo  id='3117331'>Martorell</geo> and
Can Saura, diagonally across from each other on carrer del Santissim.
Nearby is the Museu Diocesà, housed in a former convent and cloisters
on carrer Seminari. It displays archaeological and ecclesiastical
finds.
The carrer Major del <geo  id='9167557'>Born</geo> leads west from the cathedral to
dignified Plaça d’es <geo  id='9167557'>Born</geo>, the ceremonial square on the heights above
the harbor. Formerly the Moors’ parade ground, it is lined with
imposing buildings, such as the former Ajuntament (now the police
headquarters) and great 19th-century mansions (grand <geo  id='2988743'>Palau</geo> Torresaura
and <geo  id='2988743'>Palau</geo> Salord). In the middle of the square, an obelisk commemorates
a brave defense against some 15,000 besieging Turks in 1558. The town
fell after nine days, and the survivors were carried off into slavery.
Concerts are still held at the 19th-century Teatre del <geo  id='9167557'>Born</geo> on the
north side of the plaça.
From Plaça d’es <geo  id='9167557'>Born</geo>, you can view the port below, a long
curving inlet lined with fishing boats on one side and pleasure craft
on the other. The port, the focus of <geo  id='3124967'>Ciutadella</geo>’s nightlife, teems with
seafood restaurants and open-air bars.
Prehistory near <geo  id='3124967'>Ciutadella</geo>
About 5 km (3 miles) west of the city, just off the south
of the main road, stands the Naveta d’Es Tudons, one of the island’s
finest pre-Talaoitic complexes. A burial chamber — claimed as the
oldest roofed building in Europe — dates from between 1200 and 750
b.c.
Two intriguing taula sites are hidden not far away.
Heading away from <geo  id='3124967'>Ciutadella</geo>, just after Naveta d’Es Tudons, take the
next lane to the south, and after 2.5 km (11/2 miles) turn left down a
farm track to Torre Trencada. There is a signpost pointing across the
fields to the taula and a huge cave. Back on the main road, take the
next road turning south, through stone gateposts and across a farmyard,
to the largely unexcavated Torrellafuda, obscured by trees. From the
talaiot there’s a wonderful view of the surrounding countryside,
divided by rows and rows of stone walls.
Head out of <geo  id='3124967'>Ciutadella</geo> on the road towards Sant Joan de
Missa and branch off towards Son Saura; after 6 km (4 miles) you’ll
arrive at the prehistoric walled town of Son Catlar, situated in the
farmland to the east of the road. You can walk round the 900-m-
(2,880-ft-) long walls, which possibly date from about 600 b.c. ,
though on the southeastern side you can see places where, much later,
the Romans built bastions. The taula seems to have been deliberately
broken off, and it is possible that the Romans used the precinct as a
temple.
Beaches and Resorts near <geo  id='3124967'>Ciutadella</geo>
Almost every accessible cove and inlet on the coast near
<geo  id='3124967'>Ciutadella</geo> has been developed in a rash of urbanitzaciós, creating a
rash of holiday homes, hotels, and associated facilities. The resorts
are easily accessible, but their sprawl is dull and suburban. Beaches
here are very small, and overcrowded in high summer.
However, some of the island’s finest beaches, near the
middle of the southern coast, are probably best visited from
<geo  id='3124967'>Ciutadella</geo>. The sea is reached only by narrow lanes and farm tracks,
but it’s worth a trek to get away from the crowds. The twin coves of
Macarella and Macarelleta are stunning, with the kind of calm turquoise
waters and spectacular sea views <geo  id='6453301'>Menorca</geo> is known for. Macarella is
perhaps the nicest fully serviced beach on <geo  id='6453300'>Mallorca</geo>; the beautiful cove
has an excellent bar-restaurant, open daily. Macarelleta, a nudist
beach, is lovelier still. To get to it, take the path to the right of
Macarella, a 10-minute walk along the cliff.
Occasionally there are times when so many head for the
remote spots that they create a crowd there, too. A favorite spot for
both locals and tourists is pretty Cala en Turqueta, 10 km (6 miles)
from <geo  id='3124967'>Ciutadella</geo> along the Sant Joan de Missa road.
West and south of <geo  id='3124967'>Ciutadella</geo> are the busiest and dreariest
of <geo  id='6453301'>Menorca</geo>’s resorts, including Santandria, Cala <geo  id='2520940'>Blanca</geo>, Cap d’Artrutx,
and Cala en Bosç. Just west of <geo  id='3124967'>Ciutadella</geo>, Cala Blanes and the vast
area of villas and hotels near Cala Forcat make a self -contained
holiday town, though their two often scruffy little beaches can hardly
cope with the summer influx.
The northwest corner of the island, in total contrast, is
almost untouched by tourism, and environmentalists are winning
supporters who want it declared off-limits for development. Some
building at Cala Morell (8 km/5 miles northwest of <geo  id='3124967'>Ciutadella</geo>) has
jumped the gun, and a number of little white houses and blocks of
villas have sprouted on the eastern side of one of the loveliest bays
on the north coast. A maze of paths leads down to the rocky shore and
around the cliffs — a geology textbook of tortured strata. Carved into
the rock above the bay is a prehistoric necropolis dating from the 6th
century b.c. , including a cell with a sculpted façade. The oldest
caves, though, are pre-Talaoitic, dating from around 1200 b.c. West of
Cala Morell are the lovely, remote beaches of Algaiarens.
