The City and Its People
<geo  id='281184'>Jerusalem</geo> is an ever-changing combination of the earthly and
the spiritual. It can be cafés and restaurants set in the 19th-century
lanes of <ignore  id='undefined'>Nahlat Shiv’a</ignore>, or it can be the sky lit with an ethereal
sunset over the <geo  id='6945291'>Old City</geo> as muezzins call from the minarets of ancient
mosques. It is medieval bazaars, a quartet of Russian musicians
performing at the <ignore  id='undefined'>Bible Lands Museum</ignore>, or the echo of a soprano’s voice
inside the <ignore  id='undefined'>Crusader Church of St. Anne</ignore>. A walk of a few blocks can take
you into different worlds and centuries.
<geo  id='281184'>Jerusalem</geo> has been a Holy City longer than any other place
on earth. It is holy to not merely one religion but to the three great
Western monotheistic faiths: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Its fate
was changed forever 3,000 years ago when King David brought the Ark of
the Covenant to rest in a tent amid the gardens beside the waters of
<geo  id='281184'>Jerusalem</geo>’s ancient source of water, the <ignore  id='undefined'>Gihon Spring</ignore>. With those
waters, the Kings of Judah of the House of David were anointed for four
centuries. In those gardens, the Song of Songs was written by Solomon.
On the streets of <geo  id='281184'>Jerusalem</geo>, the Prophets walked and spoke; on a hill
beside the city’s walls, Jesus was crucified; from a rock on the
then-ruined <geo  id='11258705'>Temple Mount</geo>, the Prophet Muhammad made a miraculous ascent
to enter Paradise. In no other city in the world are millions of
visitors so conscious of the portentous lives of people who lived here
thousands of years ago.
In <geo  id='281184'>Jerusalem</geo>, historic moments can become mythic legend. The
saintly Omar Ibn el Khattab, second successor to Muhammad and the
Muslim conqueror of <geo  id='281184'>Jerusalem</geo> in a.d. 638, declined an invitation from
the Christian Patriarch to pray at the Holy Sepulcher for fear his
followers might then want to turn the site into a mosque. On a December
day in 1917, British General Allenby rode up to <geo  id='6957224'>Jaffa Gate</geo> and
dismounted from his horse because he would not ride where Jesus walked;
he then accepted the surrender of the city after the Ottoman Turks had
fled (the flag of surrender was a bed-sheet from the American Colony
Hotel). And millions of people have seen the photograph of an unknown
Jewish soldier fervently praying at the <geo  id='6957230'>Western Wall</geo> minutes after
Israeli forces captured the <geo  id='6945291'>Old City</geo> in 1967.
Being at the center of so much history allows for a
bewildering religious and ethnic diversity in <geo  id='281184'>Jerusalem</geo>. Bitter
rivalries exist between followers of the major religions as well as
among the sects within those religions. Reform and Orthodox Jews come
to blows at the <geo  id='6957230'>Western Wall</geo>; followers of different Christian
traditions break into fist fights over the rights to millimeters of
space inside the <ignore  id='undefined'>Church of the Holy Sepulcher</ignore>. But each tradition is a
component of <geo  id='281184'>Jerusalem</geo>’s greatness. A dozen languages echo from the
dome above the <ignore  id='undefined'>Church of the Holy Sepulcher</ignore>, and some of the
shopkeepers in the labyrinthine bazaars speak all of them and more.
In few other modern cities are you likely to see such a
variety of costumes. Hasidic Jews wear black hats, often trimmed with
fur, and long black or brocaded coats — garb dating from their origins
in 18th-century <geo  id='7729884'>eastern Europe</geo>. Palestinian Arabs might be clad in
flowing robes and keffiyes (head scarves) or in blue jeans. Nuns are in
their habits and Israeli women in military uniforms. In the bazaars
you’ll pass robed Greek Orthodox priests and Bedouin tribeswomen in
richly embroidered dresses. At holy places you’ll find Ethiopian
Christians and Jews wrapped in delicately handwoven white robes.
<geo  id='281184'>Jerusalem</geo> is the spiritual and governmental center of a
bustling nation with a lively contemporary cultural scene and a
per-capita income that ranks among the 25 highest in the world. Both
<geo  id='281184'>Jerusalem</geo> and <geo  id='294640'>Israel</geo> have undergone enormous change in a very short
time. At the end of <geo  id='294640'>Israel</geo>’s War of Independence in 1948, the nation’s
population numbered 700,000 Jews and 150,000 Arabs. During the
half-century of its existence, <geo  id='294640'>Israel</geo> has absorbed approximately 2.5
million Jewish immigrants, displaced persons, refugees, and survivors
of the Nazi Holocaust. The country’s first 20 years were consumed with
the struggle to house, feed, and educate the new arrivals, despite
austere economic conditions and the constant threat of military attack
from neighboring countries.
The population of <geo  id='294640'>Israel</geo> is today approximately 6 million,
of whom about 4,780,000 are Jews, 900,000 are Muslims, and 130,000 are
Christians. There are also nearly 100,000 Druze, members of a religious
group that broke away from Islam in the 11th century and now live
primarily in <geo  id='294932'>Galilee</geo> and on <geo  id='294579'>Mount Carmel</geo>. <geo  id='294640'>Israel</geo> is facing major
decisions about the nature of its democracy, about the relationships
between the many peoples who live here, and also about hopes for the
country’s reconciliation with its neighbors in the <geo  id='6269133'>Middle East</geo>. Nowhere
are these issues more acute than in <geo  id='281184'>Jerusalem</geo>.
The Jewish people in <geo  id='294640'>Israel</geo> are from many lands and differ
in culture, language, and customs. Some have lived in <geo  id='294640'>Israel</geo> for
generations, but most have arrived (or are descended from those who
arrived) from every part of the world since the modern Zionist movement
began in the late 19th century. Ashkenazi Jews come from central and
<geo  id='7729884'>eastern Europe</geo>. Among them are the mystical, ultra-observant Hasidim;
their enclave in <geo  id='281184'>Jerusalem</geo>, the <ignore  id='undefined'>Mea She’arim</ignore> neighborhood, is a small
remnant of those traditional Jewish communities in <geo  id='798544'>Poland</geo>, <geo  id='719819'>Hungary</geo>, and
<geo  id='597427'>Lithuania</geo> that were consumed by the Holocaust. Ashkenazi Israelis
include early-20th-century idealists from <ignore  id='undefined'>eastern Europe</ignore> who founded
<geo  id='294640'>Israel</geo>’s famous kibbutz movement, along with families who escaped from
<geo  id='2950159'>Berlin</geo> and <geo  id='6553153'>Frankfurt</geo> in the 1930s and built fashionable <geo  id='281184'>Jerusalem</geo>
neighborhoods such as Rehavia, lined with stone buildings influenced by
the Bauhaus and International schools of architecture.
Sephardic Jews are the descendants of the great Jewish
community exiled from <geo  id='2510769'>Spain</geo> in 1492 at the time of the Inquisition.
They established communities in lands surrounding the <geo  id='363196'>Mediterranean</geo> and
elsewhere. For centuries, the Sephardic Jewish neighborhoods of cities
from <geo  id='2530335'>Tangier</geo>, <geo  id='6547300'>Fez</geo>, and <geo  id='2759794'>Amsterdam</geo> to <ignore  id='undefined'>Salonika</ignore>, <geo  id='745044'>Istanbul</geo>, and <geo  id='170063'>Aleppo</geo>
echoed with Ladino, a 15th-century Castilian dialect (sprinkled with
Hebrew words) spoken by the Spanish exiles wherever they settled.
Mizrahi (or “eastern”) Jews are from <geo  id='7729897'>West Asia</geo>, <geo  id='7729893'>Central
Asia</geo>, and <geo  id='7729887'>North Africa</geo>, including black-eyed, high-cheekboned Yemenite
Jews; Jews from the mountains of <geo  id='126585'>Kurdistan</geo> and the dusty plateaus of
<geo  id='1114929'>Bukhara</geo>; and Iraqi Jews, whose community existed from the days of the
Babylonian Captivity in the sixth century b.c. until modern times.
Israelis from <geo  id='3865483'>Argentina</geo> are famous for their beef
barbecues; many American Israelis lovingly celebrate Thanksgiving and
the Fourth of July many decades after leaving the <geo  id='6252001'>United States</geo>. On the
streets of <geo  id='281184'>Jerusalem</geo>, you’ll notice signs in Ethiopian Amharic and
overhear Russian spoken by the thousands of recent immigrants from the
former <geo  id='8354411'>Soviet Union</geo>. Whatever their ancestors’ cultural and ethnic
origins, however, all native-born residents of <geo  id='294640'>Israel</geo> are called
sabras, who today make up more than half of the Jewish population.
The exotic, walled <geo  id='6945291'>Old City</geo> (excluding the Jewish Quarter)
is a treasure house preserving 1,300 years of Arabic culture and
architectural achievement, and remains the center for the many modern
Palestinian neighborhoods of <geo  id='7303419'>East Jerusalem</geo>. Palestinians comprise one
of the most educated and cosmopolitan populations in the <geo  id='6269133'>Middle East</geo>,
and within the <geo  id='6945291'>Old City</geo> — in the bazaars and neighborhood enclaves that
surround the great Christian and Islamic holy sites — an intimate and
very traditional urban style of life is maintained, filled with the
courtesy and caring found in communities where there are no
strangers.
As you plunge into this fascinating city, you’ll find that
planning your day is not easy. Each religion has a different Sabbath
and different religious holidays. A day’s itinerary is often
confounded, as shops, offices, mosques, and museums are closed for
religious or patriotic festivals, prayers, traditions, or a summer
afternoon’s siesta. But if some places close abruptly, others open just
as suddenly: <geo  id='281184'>Jerusalem</geo> is never completely at rest.
In the midst of this amazing amalgam of cultures is a
passion for continuity. Before any change can take place — even moving
a candlestick — dozens of beliefs and traditions must be consulted and
respected. By general agreement and city ordinance, all buildings must
be faced with <geo  id='281184'>Jerusalem</geo> limestone, giving the city’s different worlds
an architectural unity and tying the city in a special way to the land
on which it rests. Sheltered by houses made of the same rocks, revering
the same stories, sharing the same history, many <geo  id='281184'>Jerusalem</geo> neighbors
who come from very different backgrounds have forged unique and
extraordinary friendships. Their stories are the city’s ongoing
miracles and the source of <geo  id='281184'>Jerusalem</geo>’s hope.
