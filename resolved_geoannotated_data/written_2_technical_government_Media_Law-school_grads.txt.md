Law-school grads balking at low-pay jobs
Enormous college loans behind legal-aid snub

Law school graduates paying back $80,000 and more in college
loans are reluctant to seek low-paying jobs representing the poor,
legal experts say.
Students leaving law schools earn annual salaries as low as
$25,000 working for government public-service organizations, while
those who land jobs with top-ranked law firms make $80,000 a year
or more.
Some graduates who take jobs with Colorado Legal Services, which
handles housing and other civil disputes for the poor, pay up to
$800 a month on student loans, said Jonathan Asher, executive
director. The agency pays newly graduated lawyers $31,736 a year in
<geo  id='5419384'>Denver</geo> and $24,911 elsewhere in the state.
Top firms in <geo  id='5419384'>Denver</geo> and elsewhere pay first-year associates
$80,000 to $125,000 a year.
Galloping tuition payments have reduced the pool of applicants
for legal aid and other public service jobs, Asher said.
Nationally, law school tuition doubled between 1991 and 2001,
according to the National Association for Law Placement, based in
<geo  id='4140963'>Washington, D.C.</geo>
&#x27;A significant number of people have said that for them the
pressure of student loans eliminates their options and choices,&#x27;
Asher said.
Sixty-six percent of law students surveyed nationally in 2002
said that debt kept them from considering a job with groups like
Colorado Legal Services, said a study by the National Association
for Law Placement. And 68 percent of public-interest employers
reported difficulty in recruiting attorneys.
In 2001, median private law school tuition was about $23,000 a
year, according to the study.
The average law school graduate carries debt of more than
$84,000. That doesn&#x27;t include debt racked up on undergraduate
work.
It is a source of frustration, said Libby DeBlasio, a <geo  id='5442491'>University
of Denver</geo> law student. &#x27;It&#x27;s kind of a joke among a lot of us who
want to do public interest law. We say, &#x27;Yeah, this is what I want
to do, but I may have to work in a private firm and be a drone for
a while.&quot;
Jennifer Knight, a lawyer with Colorado Legal Services who
handles housing and other civil cases for the poor, is paying off
roughly $80,000 in loans. And she received a scholarship that paid
half her tuition at <geo  id='4945866'>Northeastern University</geo>&#x27;s law school in
<geo  id='4930956'>Boston</geo>.
Knight, 31, is a Mexican-American who grew up in a low-income
housing development. When she was still in high school, she decided
she wanted to be a lawyer and work with the poor.
Many of Knight&#x27;s fellow minority law students also were
interested in public service, she said. But most went into private
practice.
&#x27;A lot of people I went to law school with were fired up about
public practice, but they had more debt than I did,&#x27; she said.
At the state&#x27;s largest law school, the <geo  id='5442491'>University of Denver</geo>,
tuition climbed from about $15,000 to $23,994 during the past 10
years.
By comparison, tuition at the <geo  id='5583011'>University of Colorado</geo> Law School
at <geo  id='5574991'>Boulder</geo> is much lower for state residents - $6,754 a year. Out-
of-state residents pay $21,252.
So far, Asher said, Colorado Legal Services has been able to
attract the talent it needs.
The state Public Defender&#x27;s office - where new lawyers make
$43,536 a year - also continues to attract good candidates, said
Frances Smylie Brown, chief deputy.
But in the last several years, the office widened its search for
potential hires, reaching outside the state for the first time in
its history.
&#x27;We don&#x27;t have a large enough pool of applicants from <geo  id='5442491'>Denver
University</geo> and the <geo  id='5583011'>University of Colorado</geo> to fill the number of
openings we have each year,&#x27; Smylie Brown said. <geo  id='5442491'>DU</geo> has a law-
student body of about 1,000, and <geo  id='5583011'>CU</geo>&#x27;s population is about half
that.
Population growth and a corresponding increase in crime are
primarily responsible for the dwindling number of local candidates,
but interest is also waning, Smylie Brown said.
