Huss Grad Earns Law Award from College

By Erin Elizabeth Walker
Gazette Correspondent
<geo  id='4819079'>PRINCETON, W.Va.</geo> - Cathy Wallace did not always know what she
wanted to be when she grew up.
She wanted to help people, but did not know exactly how. A
suggestion from friends sparked her interest.
&quot;When I was in college, I thought I wanted to be a doctor,&quot; she
said. &quot;I found I didn&#x27;t want to do that and realized an interest in
psychology. I didn&#x27;t know what I wanted to do, but all my friends
thought I should go into law because I was always on a soapbox. I
decided to try it.&quot;
Recently, Wallace received the Outstanding Woman Lawyer in
Public Interest Law Award. The award was voted on and presented by
the women&#x27;s caucus of <ignore  id='undefined'>West Virginia University</ignore> College of Law.
Wallace, 38, called <geo  id='4467732'>Gastonia</geo> home from the age of 8 until she
graduated from <ignore  id='undefined'>Hunter Huss High School</ignore> in 1983. Her parents, Carter
Bond, 66, and Carol Bond, 59, are still residents of <geo  id='4467732'>Gastonia</geo>.
From <ignore  id='undefined'>Hunter Huss</ignore>, she moved on to pursue a degree at <ignore  id='undefined'>Pfeiffer
University</ignore> in <geo  id='4479779'>Misenheimer</geo>.
After graduation from Pfeiffer in 1987 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree
in both biology and psychology, she worked as legal secretary for
attorney Louis A. Bledsoe Jr. for a year and a half.
&quot;Working for Louis Bledsoe was a pivotal moment,&quot; she said.
&quot;That was when I decided to go into the practice of law.&quot;
She received her law degree at the <geo  id='4134519'>University of Arkansas</geo> in
1992 and began her legal career in Public Defender Corp. in
<geo  id='4819079'>Princeton</geo>. She also taught criminal justice classes at <geo  id='4799634'>Bluefield
College</geo> in <geo  id='4826850'>West Virginia</geo>.
Wallace lives in <geo  id='4797549'>Athens, W. Va.</geo>, with her husband Rob, 37, and
her daughters Rachel, 11, and Claire, 5.
Working in <geo  id='4819079'>Princeton</geo> at Legal Aid of <ignore  id='undefined'>West Virginia</ignore>, she is also
a Junior Girl Scout leader in <geo  id='4797549'>Athens</geo>, on the board of Advisors for
Children&#x27;s Home Society and on several committees for <ignore  id='undefined'>Concord
United Methodist Church</ignore>.
Legal Aid of <ignore  id='undefined'>West Virginia</ignore> provides civil legal services and
advocacy to residents of <geo  id='4826850'>West Virginia</geo>. The organization is the
result of a merger between Appalachian Legal Services and the <ignore  id='undefined'>West
Virginia</ignore> Legal Services Plan.
Wallace worked with Joyce McConnell, associate dean for academic
affairs at <ignore  id='undefined'>West Virginia University</ignore> College of Law, to set up a
Kellogg Grant internship for law students of WVU in 1990.
&quot;The students can go down into the counties and help domestic
violence victims,&quot; Wallace said. They hold workshops for women of
SAFE (Stop Abusive Family Environment).
Wallace helped to implement and supervise. McConnell spearheaded
writing the grant. They came up with the interns themselves and set
up guidelines for the internship.
Adrian Worthy, director of Legal Aid of <ignore  id='undefined'>West Virginia</ignore>, has known
Wallace for years.
&quot;She is very committed to her clients who are both low income
and have troubling domestic problems,&quot; Worthy said. &quot;Cathy is very
passionate about their concerns. She&#x27;s good at looking at the big
picture. She&#x27;s responsible for four offices and she looks at how to
deliver as many services to as many people as possible.&quot;
Wallace&#x27;s commitment has been acknowledged. She was promoted in
February to regional counsel. She manages legal services for
approximately 12 counties south of <geo  id='4801859'>Charleston, W. Va.</geo>
Wallace has enjoyed all of her work experience.
&quot;This job gives me the opportunity to help people,&quot; she said. &quot;I
go home feeling satisfied with my job.&quot;
Her mother sees Wallace&#x27;s job as simply a manifestation of who
she has always been.
&quot;She&#x27;s not just good at what she does, but she&#x27;s also helping
people,&quot; Carol Bond said. &quot;She&#x27;s always been concerned with helping
people. That&#x27;s just her nature.&quot;
