Legal Aid attorney heeds call to serve

<ignore  id='undefined'>December 30, 2002</ignore>

Depictions of lawyers in American pop culture are
notoriously unkind.
Whether castigating them on the silver screen, between the lines
of pulpy, true-crime narratives, or in the jokes told around the
proverbial water cooler, attorneys have been on the receiving end
of many a hackneyed punch line.
One <ignore  id='undefined'>Roseburg</ignore> attorney is doing her best to refute the cultural
stereotype, however. Legal Aid attorney Sharon Lee Schwartz knew
when she entered law school at <geo  id='4138892'>Georgetown University</geo> that she
wanted to use her training to help others.
&quot;A reason I went to law school was to do social justice work,&quot;
Schwartz said recently. &quot;I get paid to make the community a better
place for vulnerable people -- and I like that.&quot; Schwartz grew up
in <geo  id='4460243'>Charlotte</geo>, N.C. She earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in English
literature from <geo  id='4463053'>Davidson College</geo> before heading to <geo  id='4138892'>Georgetown</geo> for
her law degree, where she finished in 1993.
&quot;When I was in school I really liked Virginia Woolf,&quot; Schwartz
said of her nascent literary tastes. &quot;Right now what I read is
nonfiction.
&quot;I&#x27;ve been reading a lot about Buddhism,&quot; she added. &quot;I just
sort of call it my peace studies program -- any author that I think
has ideas (as to) how people can live together without killing each
other, that&#x27;s what I like to read.&quot;
Schwartz replaced former Legal Aid attorney Lori Rubenstein at
the <ignore  id='undefined'>Roseburg</ignore> office in 1996, although she initially interviewed for
the position in 1994. During that two-year interim, she worked for
Legal Aid on a reservation in <geo  id='5769223'>South Dakota</geo> practicing family,
tribal and housing law. Legal Aid is a nonprofit national
organization aimed at providing low-cost or free legal aid to those
who need it.
A <geo  id='5769223'>South Dakota</geo> blizzard six years ago prompted her to call the
<ignore  id='undefined'>Roseburg</ignore> office, which, coincidentally, was in the process of
trying to find her to fill the vacancy left by Rubenstein&#x27;s
departure.
Schwartz said her job keeps her involved in the community -- and
allows her to sleep with a sound conscience.
&quot;Just because there&#x27;s so much more demand for our services than
we can actually meet, once we actually take a case we always feel
like we&#x27;re on the right side,&quot; she said. For the time being,
however, both her sleep and her job may have to suffer some
periodic disturbance. Schwartz and her husband, Scott Cohan,
welcomed their first child into their lives last week, Sophia Clare
Cohan.
&quot;It&#x27;s wonderful,&quot; said the new mother. &quot;I mean, it&#x27;s really,
really fun.&quot;
Schwartz plans to take maternity leave until the end of
January.
Rounding out the attorney&#x27;s other full-time roles as mother to
her child and legal ally to the poor is that of amateur artist.
&quot;I guess I&#x27;ve sold a few things,&quot; Schwartz said, but &quot;mostly I
just make things for myself. &quot;I just finished a stained glass
window that I&#x27;ve been working on for four years ... I paint the
walls of my house all different colors and patterns and things like
that.&quot;
Schwartz has also tried her hand at sculpting clay -- and her
welding torch at sculpting steel.
&quot;I just want to make things that are interesting to look at,&quot;
she said. &quot;I can&#x27;t say that my art&#x27;s intended to give any
particular message.&quot;
Asked how she and her husband manage to juggle so many competing
demands upon their time, Schwartz replied, &quot;we don&#x27;t watch TV.&quot;
Schwartz tries to limit herself to a normal eight-hour work day,
she said, in spite of a heavy demand for indigent legal services in
the community. &quot;I figured out early on that I could work around the
clock and still meet only a fraction of the need,&quot; Schwartz
said.
